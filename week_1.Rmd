# Week 1

The first week of the quarter it's a bit of an adjustment from typical course.

I want you to think about what you want to learn and what skills you want to practice.

I have a few things to say about that, but for now this first week can be broken into two parts:

1. The first part is for you to think about will you want to learn and what skills you want to practice

2. The second part is for you to do arguably some busy work so that we don't lose time.


## What do you want to focus on

Some topics in the past that I have taught include the following and you may find them useful starting points to think about your own process for this quarter.

1. Critical thinking
2. Technical writing new paragraph finding published research
3. Evaluating the quality of published articles, for example contrasting popular sources from academic or scholarly.
4. General introduction to the content of psychology
5. Theories within psychology
6. Criticisms of psychology
7. Limits of psychology
8. Philosophy of science
9. Working within groups
10. Psychology as it relates to other disciplines

### recent additions

11. Power structures
12. How to have inclusive group meetings
    * what are good ground rules for meetings

Any and all of these above could qualify.

The goal here is for us to collectively think of it about what you'd like to learn in our time together.

This list is not exhaustive. There's some things that you may want to focus on or add. Perhaps this might include cognitive dissonance about being a white person and being told that you've got white privilege. What are some ways one can think about opening up to that feedback?

Although I have some expert content knowledge in psychology, it's not exhaustive. I don't know everything, I have my own biases and that there may be things you'd like to learn about and practice and I would be open to hearing those things as well as how to incorporate it into the overall class. 


## Do Some reading


1. [The syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/)

2. [Miller's law of communication (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.exo9wouxy9qk)

3. [George Orwell, Politics and the English Language, 1946 (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.f3hxyeh73uh7)

4. [The 9 standards of Critical thinking (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.j2nlxy74qee8)

5. [Textbook, chapter 1: What is Psychology?](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/1-introduction)

6. Dictionary/Wikipedia definitions on: 

      *Anthropomorphize
 
      *Ethnocentrism

7. watch intro lecture on epistemology

[![Epistemology 8min](./images/Epistemology_better.png){width="40%"}](https://youtu.be/L6fcTl_js5g "Epistemology")

8. Read about "stereotype threat".  Not stereotypes.  There is a difference.  You'll need to find a source or two on your own.  


# Do the following

1. Introduce yourself in the Canvas Introductions discussion board

2. Write something about what interests you about psychology

3. Write a post responding to the following prompts

    what is your process for thinking clearly?

    How do you know something is true?

7. Share your ideas about what you want to learn in the Canvas small group discussion

## Your work is reading and writing.  We will use slack to share a lot of our work.  This first week we'll have 1 discussion group in canvas but I'd like to move on to slack for week 2 and beyond. 

I'll share/publish those soon. You may find that using [Google Docs](http://drive.google.com) is a very good cloud-based place to store your writing.

There are other places for you to do this. Microsoft oneDrive, Dropbox, I would just recommend to not simply save them on your computer in the event that some crash happens.


But for now, you can at least begin reading, watching, and writing.
