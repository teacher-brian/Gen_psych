# Week 8 May 24  {#Week8}

This week is a more proper assignment to practice self-reflection, metacognition, and critical thinking.  It's a little bit more involved so I've put the instructions into a google document so that this page isn't overwhelming.

Be sure to ask questions in the muddy-point channel if they come up. 

Also, take a look a head for the remaining weeks of the quarter.  Lots to do and you'll need to organize your approach so that you don't fall behind. 

## Read/watch some

A. Nancy Chick, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}


## Do the following

A. [Complete the following metacog assignment posted in a google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vKwiB31xhBR9Al1guiTw2odyVcCiIWcrqslSz1cKkqk/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

B. Post to [#metacognition essay channel](https://general-psychology-hq.slack.com/archives/C022K4RCB3J){target="_blank"}, tag 2 people to review your work.  


# Week 9 Personality May 31  {#Week9}

## Be sure to check out [Week 11 on social psychology](#Week11)

As an assignment, it may be taxing so you'll want to plan out your next few weeks.

## Personality

This week is an introduction to personality.

You will want to read the textbook and to keep some ideas in mind.

The first is that there's basically four major theories of personality.  [However, there are others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology#:~:text=The%20major%20theories%20include%20dispositional,instead%20take%20an%20eclectic%20approach){target='_blank'}.  There are also offshoots and sub theories.

The four major that I think of include psychoanalysis (with several sub-types often associated with particular people), Humanistic (with existentialism as a sub-type), Cognitive-behavioral, and finally Trait/dispositional approaches (the Big-5 being the most researched).

The second thing to be aware of is that there are several persistent and possibly impossible problems to solve in studying personality. The classic example: "is a behavior the consequent of a person's personality, or internal trait system, or is that behavior a result of environmental influence?"



|Here are these persistent problems I mentioned:
|:---|
|1.  <span class='underline'>Mind/body</span>-- Descartes split body from mind with his "I think therefore I am" bit.  Some know this as Cartesian dualism, the viewpoint that mind and body are separate things.  Body has matter, mind does not, and therefore not subject to scrutiny.  Dualism fosters reductionism, the attempt to discover ‘truth’ by breaking things down into simpler units.  In personality, we often talk about motivation and so a question that comes up is whether mind has anything to do with it...but right away, then, you are locked into a dualism. 
|2. <span class='underline'>Person vs situation</span>-- Both are correct.  But for decades this was (and sometimes still is) the big friction within Personality studies.  Behavioral psychologists tend to de-emphasize  "person variables" as unimportant and insist that situations are responsible for eliciting, shaping, etc behavior.  On the other hand, Personologists tend to de-emphasize situational factors as “nuisance variables or noise”.  The debate is basically a draw.
|3. <span class='underline'>Nature vs nurture</span>-- what is **THE** cause?  Studying personality requires an acceptance of both causes are necessary.  Another way to say this is that all behavior is 100% nature and 100% nurture because our biology doesn't live in a vacuum; our biology develops in an enviorment and will be sensitive to that enviornment. 
|4. <span class='underline'>Determinism vs freedom</span>-- Mostly self explanatory; to what degree do we actually choose our behaviors?  Free will is hard to study in the lab and philosophically difficult to prove (I'm trusting what philosophers tell me).
|5. <span class='underline'>Stability vs change</span>-- personality traits consistently show stability.  However, this does not mean uniformity.  Here is one of those places I think one needs to think of interaction effects.  So, personality seems to be quite stable after your mid 20's, probably due to some biological maturation (eg, impulse control), but major life events, traumas, psychotherapy can also bring about some personality change.  
|6. <span class='underline'>Reification</span>--  treating a hypothetical construct as real. Intelligence is a hypothetical construct.  It can be used to predict behavior pretty well, sometimes, for some people, but it’s not a real ‘thing’.  Making it real would be to reify it. 
|7. <span class='underline'>Extrapolation</span>--  this is extending known data into new areas. Lots of science occurs in the lab in order to control variables and to determine effect sizes, but in the end we want to see the degree to which their findings apply to the real world.  Often this shows up when studying ‘micro’ behaviors, as in how do neurons actually affect social situations.
|8. <span class='underline'>Diversity</span>-- You will see that personality theorists often project their own personality and experiences into their theories. And given a lack of diversity in psychology for the past 100 years it’s fair to say that these theories may be lacking pluralistic values.

## Do the following

* [take the big 5 test here](http://www.personalitytest.net/ipip/index.html){target='_blank'}
    * There are 2 versions to choose from, a short and long.
    * You may want to save your output for posterity.  The output should include your score on the 5 dimensions (OCEAN) plus 6 sub-tests for a total of 30 results.
    ```{block,type='instructorNote'}
    Don't publish this in your one-doc to rule...You can if you want but it is somewhat private information. 
    ```
* In 1- 2 pages, respond to the prompt: "what do we mean by ‘identity’?"
    * Be clear about your constructs,
    * use research outside (in addition to the above sources) of the things listed above,
    * support your thinking about what identity means.  (support means use the critical thinking standards)
    * use what we’ve covered anywhere in the course.
    * This is an impossible assignment ;)
* Post your work in the [#threads](https://general-psychology-hq.slack.com/archives/C022NM4S1BK){target='_blank'} channel
* Comment with the intent to engage 1-2 of your classmates and their writing.


```{block,type='blueBackground'}
Another way to think about this assignment:   If students take an intro to psych class, should they not be able to reasonably answer the question "what is identity?"  Not exhaustively answer it, not write a master's thesis, but to be able to point to the complexity of the problem while still committing to some conclusion.
```



# Week 10 Abnormal June 7 {#Week10}

## Be sure to check out [Week 11 on social psychology](#Week11)

As an assignment it may be taxing so you'll want to plan out your next few weeks

## Abnormal Psych

Abnormal psychology has a lot of hidden dangers. Which means I have a responsibility to call out a couple of things in a way that's different than past weeks.

First thing is to Beware of the medical student syndrome. This is the tendency for medical students to self-diagnose when learning about new and exotic illnesses. The same thing happens in Abnormal psychology. The profession tries to make diagnosis clear to those who actually make diagnoses. But that means that non-experts will overestimate their own ability to accurately diagnose self and others.

So please don't. Don't diagnose yourself and don't diagnose others.  If you think that you or someone you know struggling with a mental disorder don't try to diagnose them or even offer advice. Instead ask them what they need, and listen.

## Read/Watch

* [Abnormal Psych Chapter Textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/15-introduction){target='_blank'}

* @efran_defining_2007  You'll need to look this up using the Library's database.  The specific database is called Pro-quest.  [This schedule has instructions for doing this](#PeriodicalLocator).

* [Lecture on Diathesis Stress Model](https://youtu.be/1MaaORgCHvc){target='_blank'}   15 minutes

* [Lecture on how anxiety is about survival](https://youtu.be/bVdEGLSmXlk){target='_blank'}   7 minutes

* [Optional Lectures on depression](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsr6gT7c0HT9rbpW5X-lstj){target='_blank'}  50 minutes'ish

* [Optional case study interview of a person suffering from Schizophrenia](http://faculty.seattlecolleges.edu/faculty/brian.holt/vids/AbnormVids/Schizophrenia_type_1_7min.mp4){target='_blank'} 7 min

* Questions to constantly ask about disorders
Questions to ask yourself when thinking about abnormal psychology

  * What is normal versus abnormal?  What does the textbook say?

  * What dominates your thinking about human motivation? Is there a particular psychological theory that you tend to gravitate to? For instance, are all things biological? Cognitive? Do you feel a need to simplify?

  * Remember earlier in the quarter when I had you watch the systems within psychology video. This video was a brief introduction to the fact that human motivation is layered. Certainly there are biological reasons for why we do what we do, but there's also learning histories, cognitive processes, personality variables, but also social influences. All of these things are happening all of the time. So somebody says that they're depressed, do you have a tendency to say oh there's something biological wrong? Socially wrong?

  * Keep in mind how do we measure abnormal behavior.
  * Who has the power to say one thing is normal versus another? Does that power come from cultural norms?

  * When a diagnostician gives a diagnosis, who do they serve?

## Do some stuff

* Respond to anything above.  Write maybe 2 or 3 paragraphs.  Yes, this is light.

* Share your writing with the slack Channel #abnormal  (you can search for channels in slack)

* Comment on 2 or 3 of your classmates work.

# Week 11 Social Psych June 14 {#Week11}

This week is a bit different as I'm giving a lot more instruction given the potentially provocative content.

Will still have the "read stuff, do stuff" but most instructions will be found here:

1. [Assignments are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaC-Q_UNuxG16e3CSc-zRBfJzk9X92yjQPQ0f-PDoCw/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

   * The channel will be #social-psych

2. [Final Self-reflection](https://forms.gle/52zpF3wmP4mj9m4y6){target="_blank"}




# Week 4  Jan 25 {#Week4}

## Do, Watch, and Read the following

A. Like last week, Pick a behavior--a feeling, an action, a thought, but try to keep it simple (thoughts may work here) and write a few sentences into your google doc that explains how the environment causes the behavior. Said another way, explain what is happening in the environment to elicit the behavior.  For clarification, you could say last week the biology is **how** the behavior works while this week you are explaining **when** it works. **Do this before watching/reading below**

>    As an example, consider driving a car down a street and you hit the brakes.  The behavior is the stepping on the brake.  What environmental stimulus 'caused' the stepping on the brake?

B. Read [Chapter 6 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/6-introduction){target="_blank"}

C. [Learning theories youtube playlist, videos 1: 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsCPfmo03BZBkLURdfDubMX){target='_blank'}

D. [Video on the law of effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fanm--WyQJo){target='_blank'}

E. [Remaining Learning theories youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsCPfmo03BZBkLURdfDubMX){target='_blank'}

F. @Naik_2001 [Behaviorism as a theory of personality](http://personalityresearch.org/papers/naik.html){target='_blank'}

G. Read Nancy Chick, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}

H. Read  Alfie Kohn, [The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/){target="_blank"}

## Do some stuff:

1. Reassess your understanding from above A. Can you see what has changed in your understanding?  Can you jot down some ideas that shows this new learning?  Maybe some vocabulary?  Maybe some vocab that is still confusing.
2. Is your chosen behavior better explained by classical conditioning or operant conditioning?  What key feature led you to this choice?
3. Whether or not the textbook and videos didn't lead to any new learning, identify what you would like to know more about.  What is still missing for you?
4. Choose a new behavior that you want to change its frequency.  Like eating more chocolate.  I mean less.  Less chocolate.  How might you change the **environment** so that you eat ~~more, damn~~ I mean less chocolate?
5. Link your writing for #3 and #4 to the Channel [#Learning-theory](https://app.slack.com/client/T01HC1LRHBQ/C01K2892VPZ){target="_blank"}
6. Comment and try to engage with a few of your classmates on this assignment.  
    * In particular, try to give feedback--kindly--where you found someone's writing clear or unclear.  
    * Don't simply say this is clear or not. 
    * Share your interpretations of what they wrote. You could say something like "when I read this section, I see a couple of different ways to understand it.  Here is 1, here is another.  Do one of my interpretations line up with your intentions?"
    
7. [Do A self-reflection quiz](https://forms.gle/fTvysGbvga1tLZzN9){target="_blank"}

    * the text boxes you see in this 'quiz' will expand to accommodate what you need to write.  In other words, don't feel like you must only say like 3 words.

# Appendix

## Critical Thinking

The closest thing to a rubric we may have in my class is a list of critical thinking attributes. You can find them in the [syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.j2nlxy74qee8){target=”_blank”}. 

Though the critical thinking attributes are found there, I don't spend a lot of time talking about critical thinking attitude, but they would include things like patients, humility, curiosity, etc.  They are just as important but not something I focus on in this class.

### Some Intro videos on Critical thinking

Here is a simple [Introduction to critical thinking, broadly](https://youtu.be/3CkLAMLTkmI){target='_blank'}

It doesn't go into detail about the critical thinking standards found in the syllabus; maybe a video on that will come later.  


## Using the library {#useLibrary} 

The library has set up a simple library guide for our class.  You can find it here: [Abnormal Psychology library guide](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/psych220). I

```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note: Don't pay for articles</span>

One important word of advice is to never pay for a scholarly article. If you go online and use Google, or even Google Scholar to find online sources, you may be directed to the publication that will charge you a large amount of money to access just one article.  So don’t do that.

Generally there are ways to get articles through our library, so don't pay for articles.
```


To get started with our readings, you'll need to use our Library (online, of course) to obtain many of the articles.  

Finding journal articles is a skill that gets better with practice.  This happens to be why Librarians are so helpful.  They've actually been trained so if you can't find an article, it's okay to ask librarians for help.  

In fact, here is how you can [get help from North Seattle's library staff](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/askus). 

### Relationship of an article to its Journal

Using hierarchies helps us organize information. Journal articles, or for that matter the file directories on your computer, work somewhat like an address for a person's home. There are several different parts that give us information to track down and locate whatever it is we're looking for, be it a computer file, or Journal article. Basically, a journal article  has the following components, some of which may be familiar to you :

      Database (of periodicals)
        Periodical (eg., magazine, newspaper, scholarly journal)
         Year (of publication)
           Volume Number
            Volumne Issue number
             Page Number (optional, often unnecessary)
               Article Title
                  Author

So, to find an article, you'll need to know the parts above.  When you are given a list of references, or citations, nearly all of the information needed above is given to  you.  What is not given, or at least is done implicitly with web searches, is access to the top part, the database.  

#### Here is a typical citation:

>Author(s). (year of pub). "Article Title." <span class='underline'>Periodical title</span>. Volume Number (issue number).

The information in a citation isn't presented in the same hierarchy as above, but all of the necessary parts are there.  

Here is an example citation (reference) for something we may read.  Can you identify the periodical?

>Jay Efran, Michael Lukens, Mitchell Greene. 2007. “Defining Psychotherapy: The Last 25 Years Have Taught Us That It’s Neither Art nor Science.” <span class='underline'>Psychotherapy Networker</span> 31 (2). 

Most of the items in the list above are self-explanatory. I want to focus a bit about periodicals.

```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on formatting citations: underlining publication titles</span>

In print, publication titles are *italicized*.  I have a very hard time noticing that subtle font.  

When you submit a written manuscript for printing, publication titles are <span style='text-decoration: underline'>underlined</span> because traditionally manuscripts were typed with typewriters, and to be able to type italicized words required an entire additional alphabet represented in the hammers.  So, underlining was how you could emphasize a word, and the printer--a physical person--could notice the author's formatting intent and correctly publish the final product in italics. 

It's a bit different now with our computers, obviously.  Still, I have a hard time seeing italicized words and will occasionally use underline. 

So, sometimes I'll underline pub titles, sometimes I'll italicize. I have no rule on this.  I am chaos manifested.  Beware. 
```

#### Periodicals

These are just the names of the major publication. _The New York Times_, is colloquially known as a newspaper but technically it is a periodical. <span class='underline'>The Journal of Abnormal Psychology</span> is also a periodical. 

When we search for articles, we have to first know which journal, or periodical, owns that article.  So it is a little counter intuitive but once we have identified an article we would like to read, we have to first find out whether or not our College has access to that periodical.  

To do that, we have to use our colleges periodical locator.

### Finding a journal using Periodical locator

#### Periodical locator {#PeriodicalLocator} 

Notice the first link within [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles).  It should say "Periodical Locator"

There are many databases, inside of these databases are pages of journals, and inside those journals are articles. 

**We need to use the periodical locator to determine which database houses which periodical.  With that, we can then open up that periodical and get the article**


```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on 'free' articles and tuition/fees</span>

Part of the fees that you pay as a student are used to pay subscriptions for these periodical databases. We have a small, but pretty good selection. Major universities have much larger collections due to their size and tuition/fee structure.

So in a way, you are **not** actually getting this for free because you are paying for library access. That's the benefit of taking classes from a college. If you were not an active student, you would not be able to see many of these articles.

So, download them all!
```

##### Here's the main point:  

I've given you a list of Articles to read. To read them, you must first find them; some will be out in the internet, some will be in our schools' databases. So, use the information I've given you to find out which location (database, Wikipedia, google, google scholar) you'll need to search to obtain the full article. You will start by using the periodicals locator tool.

Let's use that @efran_defining_2007 article.  

1. Go to  [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles) and click on the periodical locator.  

2. Type in the periodical for Efran's piece. 

You will see a link with the periodical's name.  Go ahead and click on this but beware of the next instruction:

3. Once you have clicked on that link you may want to start searching within that publication. But do not do that. Instead, notice a little bit further down the search box you should see something that says "View online" and beneath that you should see something that says "proquest research library".   It’s this piece we need.

That Proquest research library is the database that you've all paid fees to access. So you need to remember that database name.

4. While remembering that database name, you need to go back to  [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles).

5. Notice what is presented here.  You can see Periodical locator, but notice "A to Z" list of databases.  (You might also notice just below two links; one to academic search and the other to Proquest).

![North's Find Periodicals](/home/brian/Projects/Getting_Started/images/NorthLibrarySearch.png)

6. Click on "A to Z"

7. You might notice that there are 67 databases that North Seattle has premium access to. In our case we're going to be looking for the proquest direct database. And we can either click on the letter "P" or we can just type in proquest direct.


```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on Popular sources</span>

You may also notice the little tag "popular" next to proquest link.  That's an indicator that the articles are not peer reviewed and so aren't exactly cutting edge science. Even though this particular journal we are looking for, _Psychotherapy Networker_, is flagged as a popular type, it is a place for therapists to share their thoughts on the profession so there is a lot of value in it.

For help in distinguishing the different types of sources, the library has some guides:

* [Scholar vs popular](http://libguides.northseattle.edu/c.php?g=97441&p=630690)

* [Find Scholarly Journals](http://libguides.northseattle.edu/c.php?g=97441&p=630669)

```

8. Opening Proquest from your home, or remotely, you will need to validate your credentials. In other words, you need to prove that your are in fact students of North Seattle before you can continue, which is why you've been prompted to give your last name and student ID number. Once you do that you'll then be able to see inside of the proquest database. Then you can now search for the article.

9. You should see you simple search box, where you can enter in important bits of information. I often start with the author's last name, in this case, Efran,and then some unique identifying feature of the article. A few key words of the article title, or perhaps the full article title will be useful.

But notice that next to the text boxes there are drop down menus. You need to use those, otherwise the search engine will just search for your terms anywhere in the document and will provide too many 'hits'. Instead, you should indicate ‘Efran’ as author, and "defining" in the document title. (of course, you could search any way you like).

When you search for those two terms in their respective fields, you will get two hits and one of them is the article we need. You should notice that it is a full text, not all databases provide full text documents. But in this case it's a full text. You can either print it or read it online.

Yay.  Now you can find the other articles.
