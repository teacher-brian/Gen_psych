# Week 6 Oct 31 {#Week6} 

```{block, type='instructorNote'}
On Thursday, May 12, there will be no classes held for the whole school.  

Faculty are expected to be doing other college work.  

Which means none of you can be required to attend any class on 5/12.  For any class.  In the whole Seattle college district.  
```

## Read the following

A. Read/skim [Primer for Behaviorism and Semantic networks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MMziOQh7NjWRnrzCZDT99ArOu8Nv6CzQfTEfbSCzjYA/){target="_blank"}. This will be a review, basically.

* skim this but pay closer attention the semantic sections with the schematics for cars
* Think of a subject.  Maybe it's something academic like math, biology.  Maybe it's about sports, or in particular a single sport, like (the only one that matters) basketball.
   * in what specific ways would the semantic network be different between a novice and expert?  I don't expect you to know technical terms here (like nodes, edges) but I want you to have an appreciation for how people may differ in terms of their networks.  How do experts differ from novices in terms of their networks.  Are they more complicated?  More lines?  Different organization?  

B. Read/skim [Chapter 8 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/8-introduction){target="_blank"}

C. Read [How to Study, By Brian Holt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9LFqr5DQnj_0HU7lQrTdmo9kG2otEITHXUrGzYQdvg/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

## Do the following

1. Identify the metaphorical dragons that interfere with your learning. Maybe one of them is anxiety about performing well. And this dragon makes it difficult to focus and to filter out extraneous distractions. Or maybe another dragon is the lure of interesting things in your social network making your phone buzzed with texts or other activity.  Maybe it’s a dragon of inertia, making it hard to start new things.  There are many dragons.

2. After you’ve listed a few (at least 2) of these dragons, what can you do to either slay these dragons, or can you use them, trick them to actually help you learn new material?  If you aren’t sure where to begin, you might consider your textbook (ch's 7 and 8) and to read that material again as if you’ve been given a secret scroll...a treasure map that helps you.  Obviously the textbook is not going to give you a simple formula like " problem x is solved by y". But if you take this adventure, keep notes as you re-read the chapters.  Ask the chapters questions...even if the chapter can't answer it.

3. Write down your solutions and post them, or at least the ones with which you feel comfortable sharing in the #[Dragon channel](https://generalpsycho-g7p7362.slack.com/archives/C03E6E7SV37){target='_blank'}.

4. Once you have shared material to #Dragon, Reply to your post, in thread, and tag 3 people in our class by using the @ symbol and their name.  Ask them to take a look at your work and ask them for feedback on some part.  Maybe it's your writing--like word choice and/or clarity.  Maybe it's something about your critical thinking.  This is hard ask to make of others but try it anyway.  Also, because it's still the pandemic and everything is just hard, don't fret if people you invite can't respond. It's likely that they are just overwhelmed with something.  

5. If you are invited to give feedback to people's writing, be kind.  

    * Remember that they are trying things out and are sharing potentially vulnerable parts of their lives.  If you need help giving feedback, send your instructor a /dm and I can help.

    * also, you don't have to respond to everyone who invites you.

    * If you do respond, think about what was asked of you.  Don't try to solve any problems but instead find ways to ask questions.  "I wonder if there is another way for this section to be more clear becauseI see a few different ways to interpret what you said."  That's just an example.  But the key is ask questions and to not simply say "this is wrong" or something aggressive like that.



# Week 7  Nov 7 {#Week7}

## Read the following:


* [William Perry's development theory on thought](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/perry.positions.html){target='_blank'}

* [Developmental Chapter Textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/9-introduction){target='_blank'}

* Places to Intervene in a System [-@meadows_leverage_1999 -this link goes to our schedule's References at the bottom; <b>there you'll find a link to the actual document...Right click that link to open it</b>]  (But here is a direct link to the document: [https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/){target="_blank"} )
   * This is both at times an easy and difficult read.  It's lengthy.  Give yourself time. Take notes.  Think of examples that apply to you.
   * [Class video as an intro to systems.  I think this might be very helpful](https://youtu.be/b3ylatiAbBs){target='_blank'}

Piaget Videos

* [Developmental playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswtr-oKhhK78fBfQlBLZHTN9){target='_blank'}

### Brian's workflow video

In my abnormal psych class, I was asked to show how I might use tools to solve a question.  Here is a 36 minute video to that end. You might find it useful to see what I mean by "having a workflow" as a way to think critically. 

[Brian's workflow on whether Acute stress disorder is a good predictor of developing PTSD](https://youtu.be/y0V92Ggp0sc){target="_blank"}.  Admittedly, it's a bit tedious.  You should watch this on 2x speed.


## Do some work:

* Think about something in the developmental chapter (your choice), like attachment or Piaget (equilibrium), as a systems approach.

* From a systems point of view, using some of Meadows [-@meadows_leverage_1999] concepts, explain why upset toddlers go to mom. In a document, write down your ideas.

* Look at your "dragon" posts again.  Consider them from a systems point of view.  What is the focal "stock" of the system?  In the same document as above, write a bit about how positive and negative feedback loops help you avoid doing work.

* Post your one-document again in the [#systems](https://generalpsycho-g7p7362.slack.com/archives/C03EZ633KNK){target='_blank'} channel.




# Week 8 Nov 14  {#Week8}

This week is a more proper assignment to practice self-reflection, metacognition, and critical thinking.  It's a little bit more involved so I've put the instructions into a google document so that this page isn't overwhelming.

Be sure to ask questions in the muddy-point channel if they come up. 

Also, take a look a head for the remaining weeks of the quarter.  Lots to do and you'll need to organize your approach so that you don't fall behind. 

## Read/watch some

A. Nancy Chick, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}


## Do the following

A. [Complete the following metacog assignment posted in a google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hCDt07L5NhMy0SQDW3k9g9O14YF0k0R-Gklzd7rTP4A/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

B. Post to [**#metacognition**](https://generalpsycho-g7p7362.slack.com/archives/C03GACAF36H){target="_blank"} channel, tag 2 people to review your work.  




# Week 9 Personality Nov 21 {#Week9}

## Be sure to check out [Week 11 on social psychology](#Week11)

As an assignment, it may be taxing so you'll want to plan out your next few weeks.

## Personality

This week is an introduction to personality.

You will want to read the textbook and to keep some ideas in mind.

The first is that there's basically four major theories of personality.  [However, there are others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology#:~:text=The%20major%20theories%20include%20dispositional,instead%20take%20an%20eclectic%20approach){target='_blank'}.  There are also offshoots and sub theories.

The four major theories that I think of include psychoanalysis (with several sub-types often associated with particular people), Humanistic (with existentialism as a sub-type), Cognitive-behavioral, and finally Trait/dispositional approaches (the Big-5 being the most researched).

The second thing to be aware of is that there are several persistent and likely impossible problems to solve in studying personality. The classic example: "is a behavior the consequent of a person's personality--like an internal trait system, or is that behavior a result of environmental influence?"



|Here are these persistent problems I mentioned:
|:---|
|1.  <span class='underline'>Mind/body</span>-- Descartes split body from mind with his "I think therefore I am" bit.  Some know this as Cartesian dualism, the viewpoint that mind and body are separate things.  Body has matter, mind does not, and therefore not subject to scrutiny.  Dualism fosters reductionism, the attempt to discover ‘truth’ by breaking things down into simpler units.  In personality, we often talk about motivation and so a question that comes up is whether mind has anything to do with it...but right away, then, you are locked into a dualism. 
|2. <span class='underline'>Person vs situation</span>-- Both are correct.  But for decades this was (and sometimes still is) the big friction within Personality studies.  Behavioral psychologists tend to de-emphasize  "person variables" as unimportant and insist that situations are responsible for eliciting, shaping, etc behavior.  On the other hand, Personologists tend to de-emphasize situational factors as “nuisance variables or noise”.  The debate is basically a draw.
|3. <span class='underline'>Nature vs nurture</span>-- what is **THE** cause?  Studying personality requires an acceptance of both causes are necessary.  Another way to say this is that all behavior is 100% nature and 100% nurture because our biology doesn't live in a vacuum; our biology develops in an enviorment and will be sensitive to that enviornment. 
|4. <span class='underline'>Determinism vs freedom</span>-- Mostly self explanatory; to what degree do we actually choose our behaviors?  Free will is hard to study in the lab and philosophically difficult to prove (I'm trusting what philosophers tell me).
|5. <span class='underline'>Stability vs change</span>-- personality traits consistently show stability.  However, this does not mean uniformity.  Here is one of those places I think one needs to think of interaction effects.  So, personality seems to be quite stable after your mid 20's, probably due to some biological maturation (eg, impulse control), but major life events, traumas, psychotherapy can also bring about some personality change.  
|6. <span class='underline'>Reification</span>--  treating a hypothetical construct as real. Intelligence is a hypothetical construct.  It can be used to predict behavior pretty well, sometimes, for some people, but it’s not a real ‘thing’.  Making it real would be to reify it. 
|7. <span class='underline'>Extrapolation</span>--  this is extending known data into new areas. Lots of science occurs in the lab in order to control variables and to determine effect sizes, but in the end we want to see the degree to which their findings apply to the real world.  Often this shows up when studying ‘micro’ behaviors, as in how do neurons actually affect social situations.
|8. <span class='underline'>Diversity</span>-- You will see that personality theorists often project their own personality and experiences into their theories. And given a lack of diversity in psychology for the past 100 years it’s fair to say that these theories may be lacking pluralistic values.

## Read/Watch

* [Personality Chapter Textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/11-introduction){target='_blank'}

* Video's on personality (about 1.3 hours) (Brian Added these on 5/26/21)
  * [Personality part 1](https://youtu.be/IhYt6xhG-6Q){target='_blank'}
  
  * [Personality part 2](https://youtu.be/0lJqfoT-W0Y){target='_blank'}


```{block,type='blueBackground'}
Please don't skip these following videos/pods--stroke of insight and words.  Let me know if the links don't work for you. 
```

* [Stroke of Insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTrJqmKoveU){target='_blank'}    about 20 minutes

* [radiolab on words](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91725-words/){target='_blank'}    about 60 minutes (3 segments)

## Do the following

* [take the big 5 test here](http://www.personalitytest.net/ipip/index.html){target='_blank'}
    * There are 2 versions to choose from, a short and long.
    * You may want to save your output for posterity.  The output should include your score on the 5 dimensions (OCEAN) plus 6 sub-tests for a total of 30 results.
    ```{block,type='instructorNote'}
    Don't publish this in your one-doc to rule...You can if you want but it is somewhat private information. 
    ```
* In 1- 2 pages, respond to the prompt: "what do we mean by ‘identity’?"
    * Be clear about your constructs,
    * use research outside (in addition to the above sources) of the things listed above,
    * support your thinking about what identity means.  (support means use the critical thinking standards)
    * use what we’ve covered anywhere in the course.
    * This is an impossible assignment ;)
* Post your work in the [#threads](https://generalpsycho-g7p7362.slack.com/archives/C03GX0LH023){target='_blank'} channel
* Comment with the intent to engage 1-2 of your classmates and their writing.


```{block,type='blueBackground'}
Another way to think about this assignment:   If students take an intro to psych class, should they not be able to reasonably answer the question "what is identity?"  Not exhaustively answer it, not write a master's thesis, but to be able to point to the complexity of the problem while still committing to some conclusion.
```


* Re-Read/skim Nancy Chick, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}

* Re-Read/skim Alfie Kohn, [The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/){target="_blank"}

* [Do A self-reflection Survey--be sure to seelct week 9 self-reflection](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCKXCNvH-nSdnuCz0OrFUcQPZXVEugR4D5lyBiZzNKYVkANw/viewform?usp=sf_link){target="_blank"}

    * the text boxes you see in this survey will expand to accommodate what you need to write.  In other words, don't feel like you must only say like 3 words to just fit the box shown.


# Week 10 Abnormal Nov 28 {#Week10}

## Be sure to check out [Week 11 on social psychology](#Week11)

As an assignment it may be taxing so you'll want to plan out your next few weeks

## Abnormal Psych

Abnormal psychology has a lot of hidden dangers. Which means I have a responsibility to call out a couple of things in a way that's different than past weeks.

First thing is to Beware of the medical student syndrome. This is the tendency for medical students to self-diagnose when learning about new and exotic illnesses. The same thing happens in Abnormal psychology. The profession tries to make diagnosis clear to those who actually make diagnoses. But that means that non-experts will overestimate their own ability to accurately diagnose self and others.

So please don't. Don't diagnose yourself and don't diagnose others.  If you think that you or someone you know struggling with a mental disorder don't try to diagnose them or even offer advice. Instead ask them what they need, and listen.

## Read/Watch

* [ADHD youtube primer, about 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouZrZa5pLXk){target='_blank'}
  * if you ever wondered if you have ADHD, this might be helpful (thought don't diagnose yourself with just this video. You need a trained diagnostician to do it right).

* [Abnormal Psych Chapter Textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/15-introduction){target='_blank'}

* @efran_defining_2007 This has some nice controvertial and provocative ideas.  Not everyone will like them. You'll need to look this up using the Library's database.  The specific database is called Pro-quest.  [This schedule has instructions for doing this](#PeriodicalLocator).

* [Lecture on Diathesis Stress Model](https://youtu.be/1MaaORgCHvc){target='_blank'}   15 minutes

* [Lecture on how anxiety is about survival](https://youtu.be/bVdEGLSmXlk){target='_blank'}   7 minutes

* [Optional Lectures on depression](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsr6gT7c0HT9rbpW5X-lstj){target='_blank'}  50 minutes'ish

* [Optional case study interview of a person suffering from Schizophrenia](http://faculty.seattlecolleges.edu/faculty/brian.holt/vids/AbnormVids/Schizophrenia_type_1_7min.mp4){target='_blank'} 7 min

* Questions to ask yourself when thinking about abnormal psychology

  * What is normal versus abnormal?  What does the textbook say? What is missing?

  * What dominates your thinking about human motivation? Is there a particular psychological theory that you tend to gravitate to? For instance, are all things biological? Cognitive? Do you feel a need to simplify?

  * Remember earlier in the quarter when I had you watch the systems within psychology video. This video was a brief introduction to the fact that human motivation is layered. Certainly there are biological reasons for why we do what we do, but there's also learning histories, cognitive processes, personality variables, but also social influences. All of these things are happening all of the time. So somebody says that they're depressed, do you have a tendency to say oh there's something biological wrong? Socially wrong?

  * Keep in mind: how do we measure abnormal behavior?
  * Who has the power to say one thing is normal versus another? Does that power come from cultural norms? Somewhere else? Do we give up this power?  Are we aware we have some power?

  * When a diagnostician gives a diagnosis, who do they serve?

## Do some stuff

* Respond to anything above.  Write maybe 2 or 3 paragraphs.  Yes, this is light.

* Share your writing with the slack Channel **#abnormal**  (you can search for channels in slack)

* Comment on 2 or 3 of your classmates work.
