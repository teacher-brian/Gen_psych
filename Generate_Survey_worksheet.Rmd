# Worksheet 1: Writing Effective Survey Questions

**Overview**  
This worksheet guides you through the first stages of developing a research survey: planning, drafting, and conducting a quality check.  
Follow each step carefully and record your notes in the spaces provided.

---

## Stage 1: Plan the Project

Goal: Identify what your survey is about and why it matters.

| Task | Description | Your Notes |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Pick a topic | What do you want to measure? | |
| Pick an audience | Who will answer the questions? | |
| Define the construct | Write the main psychological or behavioral concept (for example, motivation, stress, belonging). | |
| Write one-sentence operational definition | Explain exactly how you will recognize or measure the construct. Example: "Academic stress refers to the self-reported pressure students feel about grades and workload." | |
| Note ethics and consent needs | Will your questions ask for private or sensitive information? How will you protect confidentiality? | |
| Decide scope and time window | How many participants do you expect, and how long will the survey take to complete? | |

---

## Stage 2: Draft Items

Goal: Create a pool of possible survey questions before editing.

| Task | Description | Your Draft Work |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Generate an item pool | Write 10–15 possible survey items. Each should express a single idea. | |
| Choose response scale candidates | Select possible response formats (for example, at minimum a 7-point Likert scale, Yes/No, frequency scale). | |
| Write clear instructions | Draft a short sentence for participants explaining how to answer (for example, "Please indicate how often you feel this way."). | |
| Group items and set order | Arrange questions logically (for example, by theme or difficulty). | |
### Example item pool drafts (single-idea items)

Below are example item pools you can adapt. Each item is a single idea and can be used with a 7-point Likert scale (Strongly Disagree, Mostly Disagree, Disagree, Neither, Agree, Mostly Agree, Strongly Agree) unless otherwise noted.

#### A. Campus belonging (12 items)
1) I feel like I am part of the campus community.
2) I can find at least one group on campus where I fit in.
3) I feel comfortable asking classmates for help.
4) I feel comfortable asking instructors for help.
5) I have at least one friend on campus I can rely on.
6) I feel welcome in my classes.
7) I feel respected by people on this campus.
8) I know where to go on campus when I need support.
9) I see people like me represented in campus activities.
10) I feel safe expressing my opinions in class.
11) I feel connected to at least one campus organization or resource.
12) I am likely to return next term because I feel I belong here.

Recommended scale: 1 = Strongly disagree ... 7 = Strongly agree.

#### B. Academic stress (6 items)
1) In the past 2 weeks, I felt stressed about my coursework.
2) I often feel I have too many deadlines at once.
3) I worry about meeting my instructors’ expectations.
4) I lose sleep because of schoolwork.
5) I feel rushed when completing assignments.
6) I feel tense during exams.
<!-- 7) I have trouble relaxing after studying. -->
<!-- 8) I feel overwhelmed by the amount of reading. -->
<!-- 9) I find it hard to balance school with other responsibilities. -->
<!-- 10) I feel tired during class because of school-related stress. -->
<!-- 11) I put off assignments because they feel overwhelming. -->
<!-- 12) I feel pressure to get top grades. -->

Recommended scale: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, 5 = Always.

#### C. Study habits (3 items)
1) I set specific goals before each study session.
2) I plan my study time on a weekly schedule.
3) I review class notes within 24 hours of each class.
<!-- 4) I break large assignments into smaller tasks. -->
<!-- 5) I study in a place with few distractions. -->
<!-- 6) I turn off or silence notifications while studying. -->
<!-- 7) I quiz myself to check my understanding. -->
<!-- 8) I use practice problems when they are available. -->
<!-- 9) I ask for help when I do not understand something. -->
<!-- 10) I start assignments at least two days before they are due. -->
<!-- 11) I take short breaks during long study sessions. -->
<!-- 12) I adjust my study strategies based on feedback. -->

Recommended scale: 1 = Never ... 5 = Always.

### Quick rewrite guide: avoid and improve

Use this to catch common wording problems before pilot testing.

| Problem type | Avoid (do not use) | Better (single idea, neutral) |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Double-barreled | I feel welcome and supported by instructors and classmates. | I feel welcome in my classes.<br> I feel welcome by instructors<br> I feel supported by instructors<br> I feel welcome by classmagtes||
| Leading/loaded | How helpful are the excellent student services on campus? | How helpful are student services on campus? |
| Vague frequency | I often feel behind in class. | In the past 2 weeks, I felt behind in class. |
| Ambiguous term | I feel successful at school. | I am satisfied with my grades this term. |

### Simple response scale templates (copy/paste)

- Agreement (7-point, and preferred):Strongly Disagree, Mostly Disagree, Disagree, Neither, Agree, Mostly Agree, Strongly Agree
- Agreement (5-point): Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither, Agree, Strongly agree
- Frequency (provide a time period): "how often do you [do thing] each [time period]? Eg, [check text messages] per [hour].
- Intensity (scale): from 0 to 10
- Intensity (5-point): Not at all, Slightly, Moderately, Very, Extremely
- Ability (5-point): Not at all able, Slightly able, Somewhat able, Very able, Completely able
- Yes/No: Yes, No

Tip: Keep the scale direction and labels consistent across all items in a given survey.
<br>Statistical Tip: generally you should use more than 5 point scales...7 at minimum. I would even use 9 or 11 because some constructs may elicit a few extreme responses, even if most poeple might pick "neutral" or the middle score, a few people may have very extreme ratings.  A 5 point scale might not be wide enough.

## Stage 3: Quality Check

Goal: Ensure your questions are clear, fair, and aligned with your construct.

| Criterion | Self-Check | Revisions Needed |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Clarity – Each question is short and uses simple words. |  |  |
| Neutrality – Avoids leading or emotionally loaded wording. |  |  |
| Single idea per item – No double-barreled or compound questions. |  |  |
| Consistency – Same scale format and direction throughout. |  |  |
| Alignment – Each item matches your operational definition. |  |  |
| Ethical sensitivity – Avoids personal or identifying details. |  |  |

---

Instructor Tip:  
After completing the Quality Check, exchange worksheets with a peer.  
Each peer should mark unclear wording and suggest one specific improvement per item.

# Worksheet 2: Pilot Testing Your Survey

Goal: Pilot testing helps you find confusing, biased, or inconsistent questions before collecting real data.  
Use this worksheet to plan, conduct, and document your pilot phase.

---

## Stage 4: Pilot Testing

| Step | Task | Description | Notes / Evidence |
|------|------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | Test with 3–5 peers | Identify a small group similar to your target audience if possible. Have them complete your survey under realistic conditions (same format, device, or timing you plan to use). | |
| 2 | Collect notes on confusion and usability | Ask peers to highlight any questions they found confusing, ambiguous, or difficult to answer. Record all comments, especially those mentioned by more than one person. | |
| 3 | Conduct optional short interviews | (Optional but recommended) After completion, ask a few participants brief "think-aloud" questions such as: <br>• What did you think this item was asking? <br>• Was any question hard to answer or too personal? <br>• Did any response options not fit your experience? | |
| 4 | Summarize feedback | Review peer notes and interview summaries. Group issues into categories: wording problems, unclear scales, confusing order, etc. | |

---

## Decision Point: Were Issues Found?

| Question | Response (check one) | Explanation |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Did any pilot participants misunderstand a question or scale? | [ ] Yes   [ ] No | |
| Did participants skip questions or choose "neutral" due to confusion? | [ ] Yes   [ ] No | |
| Did wording or formatting cause bias or discomfort? | [ ] Yes   [ ] No | |

---

## If "Yes": Revise Wording and Scales

List each problem area and how you revised it. Use clear evidence from your pilot notes.

| Item Number | Original Wording / Problem | Type of Issue (for example, unclear, leading, inconsistent scale) | Revision and Rationale |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| . |  |  |  |
| . |  |  |  |
| . |  |  |  |
| . |  |  |  |
---

## If "No": Select Final Items

If no major issues were found, finalize your survey instrument.

| Task | Description | Completed (Y/N) |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Select final items | Keep only clear, relevant, and balanced questions. |  |
| Confirm consistent scales | Ensure all response options follow the same direction and wording. |  |
| Proofread for clarity | Read the entire survey aloud to catch awkward phrasing or repetition. |  |
| Record final version | Save a dated copy labeled "Final Pilot Version" before collecting real data. |  |

---

## Reflection

Write a short paragraph (4–6 sentences) summarizing what you learned from the pilot process. Consider:

* What patterns did you notice in participant feedback?  
* Which changes made the survey clearer or more reliable?  
* How confident are you that your final items now measure the intended construct?
