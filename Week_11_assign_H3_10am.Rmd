# Week 11 (Dec 7) {#Week11}

This week is a bit different as I'm giving a lot more instruction given the potentially provocative content.

Will still have the "read stuff, do stuff" but most instructions will be found here:

## 1. [Assignments are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaC-Q_UNuxG16e3CSc-zRBfJzk9X92yjQPQ0f-PDoCw/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

   * The channel will be [#week-11](https://canvas.seattlecolleges.edu/courses/16702/modules/items/780113){target="_blank"}

## 2. [Final Self-reflection](https://forms.gle/VhfLKCBMugfDJuy18){target="_blank"}

## 3. All work should be completed by end of day, December 15, 2023
