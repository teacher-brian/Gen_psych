# Background before we begin

  A. First of all, welcome. My intention is to keep instructions brief and simple. 

  B. You are always welcome to ask for clarification. It is helpful to your instructor if you try to ask the class first because often the class can be helpful. So, please first ask a question in slack. If it's personal, please use my email account brian.holt@seattlecolleges.edu

  C. It is absolutely crucial that students, teachers, all of us, respect that everybody comes to this class with different experiences, abilities, and intentions..

  D. It can be embarrassing to ask for help. Please try to ask anyway.

  E. My intention as the instructor is to teach you ways to evaluate quality knowledge and to practice quality thinking and quality writing. The context of this endeavor is going to be in psychology.

  F. Computer requirements: 

   1. You must have access to a real computer for writing. If you cannot afford a laptop or do not have a laptop or computer please contact me because we actually have free rentals for students. 

   2. A tablet or smartphone will be insufficient. It's fine to do some communication (texting etc) using those tools, but for real writing you're going to need a real computer or a laptop. 
  
  3. You'll need to have quality access to the internet.  IF you don't have consistent access to the internet from home, we have loaner hotspots that you can borrow for free.  They should give you internet at home.
  
G. Software (apps)

  1. A web browser, like firefox, chrome. 

  2. A free Google doc account. If you have Gmail you already have a Google account for documents and spreadsheets. **This is a requirement; no other word processing software will be allowed.** I have reasons and we can talk about them but unless it is related to a disability accommodation you must be using Google docs.

  3. You will need Slack, which is a communication platform; you can use the web browser version or you can use the desktop version. I use the desktop version and I also have it installed on my smartphone.  The main purpose of slack is for communication between students and the teacher.

H. Here is the pattern of the course: 

  1. Each week you will be given a list of things to read and it's list of things to do. 
  2. Most of what you'll do is some type of writing assignment in google docs. I will give you instructions and support for how to do this. 
  3. When you have finished the weeks assignment, you will post a link to your work in slack.



# Week 1 April 3 {#Week1} 

## What do you want to focus on
Think about what you want to learn:

Some topics in the past that I have taught include the following and you may find them useful starting points to think about your own process for this quarter.

1. Critical thinking
2. Technical writing new paragraph finding published research
3. Evaluating the quality of published articles, for example contrasting popular sources from academic or scholarly.
4. General introduction to the content of psychology
5. Theories within psychology
6. Criticisms of psychology
7. Limits of psychology
8. Philosophy of science
9. Working within groups
10. Psychology as it relates to other disciplines
11. Power structures
12. How to have inclusive group meetings
    * what are good ground rules for meetings

Any and all of these above could qualify.
The goal here is for us to individually and collectively think of about what you'd like to learn in our time together.

This list is not exhaustive. There's some things that you may want to focus on or add. Perhaps this might include cognitive dissonance about being a white person and being told that you've got white privilege. What are some ways one can think about opening up to that feedback?

Although I have some expert content knowledge in psychology, I don't know everything. I have my own biases. But I might be someone who can help guide you.

I'm sure there may be things you'd like to learn about and practice and I would be open to hearing those about things, maybe find ways to incorporate them into the overall class. 

## Read Some stuff

1. [The syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/){target=”_blank”}

2. [Miller's law of communication (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.exo9wouxy9qk){target=”_blank”}

3. [George Orwell, Politics and the English Language, 1946 (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.f3hxyeh73uh7){target=”_blank”}

4. [The 9 standards of Critical thinking (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.j2nlxy74qee8){target=”_blank”}

5. [Textbook, chapter 1: What is Psychology?](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/1-introduction){target=”_blank”}

6. Dictionary/Wikipedia definitions on: 

      *Anthropomorphize
 
      *Ethnocentrism

```{block,type='blueBackground'}

Okay, the following items ( 7 & 8) deserve a little bit of explanation on my side, and patience on yours.  You may be a very practical sort of person who very much does not like philosophy.  Still, without it, we would not have science. It's True!  Do you know what  Ph.D stands for?  Check it out.

Anyway.  While watching these videos, and reading the sources, just down some notes, including reactions, emotions and thoughts, try to track where your mind wanders (if it wanders), also notice when you get distracted, for example, what part of the reading or video were you just watching?  And don't be afraid to keep asking the question 'so what?' about any and all content. 

That's the kind of question you can put in your one-document-to-rule, or even ask questions on the [muddy point channel](https://winter23gener-bar7482.slack.com/archives/C04GX78BCTY){target="_blank"}


Also, I hope to make these videos a lot better in terms of production.  I think I made them at the beginning of the pandemic and well, bleh.
```
7. Watch intro lecture on epistemology

[![Epistemology 8min](../images/Epistemology_better.png){width="40%"}](https://youtu.be/L6fcTl_js5g "Epistemology"){target='_blank'}

8. Read about "stereotype threat".  Not stereotypes.  There is a difference.  You'll need to find a source or two on your own and be sure to keep track of your sources; include them in your writing as necessary.  


## Do the following

1. Introduce yourself in the Slack [#introductions](https://spr23generalpsych.slack.com/archives/C0514R6J7M4){target=”_blank”} channel

2. Take a look at the [Getting_started](https://rpubs.com/briholt/Getting_started/){target=”_blank”}, in particular the menu item __Using Google Docs__.

3. Frequently asked questions 

4. Write something about what interests you about psychology in your one google doc..remember, have one document. Be sure to give it a title.  Write about things that interest you and ponder whether psychology is related.  **Don't write a book report**.  Be honest, here. I'm not interested in what you **think** you should be interested.  So if you aren't interested in psych, that's okay!.  Some people take this course because it's a prereq for other courses.  That's okay!

5. On the same google document, make a new page, title it, and write some thoughts down to the following prompts.  

    a) What is your process for thinking clearly?

    b) How do you know something is true?
    

6. [Red scare assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17cknH7NPIA6h9AZXirtSAxFGTvNC_pwYYJhEdcTE3J8/edit){target=”_blank”} 

   *  Do this one without over thinking it.  
   *  add this to your google doc.  You can add it as a new page.

7. When you are done, post to the [#week-1](https://spr23generalpsych.slack.com/archives/C051DQ6JK7W){target="_blank"} Slack channel by including a link to your document from step 2 above. 
    -  There is a weird behavior I've not seen before.  This link does go to Week1, but then it shifts to resources.  That's weird.  You may have to search for week 1.

8. Read some of your classmates' posts and comment on some.

## Orienting comment

If you're relatively new to taking college classes, you might find it disconcerting that we don't simply have you remember a list of vocabulary words. Sometimes memorization is good. In psychology, as an example, the term "negative reinforcement" is often confused with a form of punishment.  It's not.  Can't be. Punishment is not reinforcement. But that's a digression.

Memory is a relatively shallow level of knowledge. Check out this simple hierarchy pertaining to thinking: [Bloom's taxonomy ](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/blooms-taxonomy-learning-activities-and-assessments){target="_blank"} [-@centreforteachingexcellenceBloomTaxonomyLearning2019].  If you expand the "cognitive domain" you'll see that remembering and understanding are pretty low on this scale.  There are other scales out there, but Bloom is well known.

You might also notice that summary is much lower than synthesis, which is way over under "create". 

Back to my point, vocabulary is a very low level type of knowledge. It's not without importance. The more you immerse yourself into a discipline, you'll need to know the vocab for efficient/accurate information.  But that will come while you are in your groove.

And, so, the reasons that human beings create schools and classes, such as ours, is to learn things in a deeper way.

You may be interested to know in Psychology, what causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. You might wonder what causes bipolar disorder or why is it that you enjoy one type of activity but somebody else does not. Or perhaps how it is that certain romantic partners get along while others do not. These are all interesting questions and curiosities.

The moment you start getting into those questions, it would be nice if there were short answers but those short answers are usually simplistic and shallow.

So we have to practice, and it is a practice--you don't just get an education and stop learning--you have to keep practicing what you know and how you know it. And it turns out that 'how you know something' is a philosophical question.

So, week 2 is going to be a lot to do with philosophy. It overlaps a little bit with the materials you watched during week one. But the idea is that you're going to have to reflect a little bit about this epistemological question: how do you know what you know?

```{block, Dangers of URLs, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='underline'>Note on References and only using URLs</span>

Your instructor will frequently remind you to not rely on URLs when referencing. If the URL is available, you should include it in the reference, but whenever you are supporting a claim with a reference you should fill out the full reference, including the author, the year it was published, its title, and the publisher. The reason is that URLs will change from time to time as this happened to your instructor with the bloom taxonomy link.
```


## Read Some stuff

1. Re-read the critical thinking items in the syllabus
  * Write them in your one document to rule them all and give a one-sentence description of each **using your own words.**  

2. Read [Chapter 2 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/2-introduction){target="_blank"}

3. Read @Schwartz1771, [The importance of stupidity in scientific research
](https://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771){target='_blank'}

4. Read [Red scare evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g6-uJELM5zgb-yTRCQ8Ah76P9FccFZ_V2GK6YwP3iw/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}


## Do the following
0. reminder to write down descriptions of the critical thinking standards in your own words.
1. write a synthesis of the 4 sources above (critical thinking, stupidity in science, red scare evaluation, chapter 2).  You may want to consider comment about whether you think knowledge is static.  

```{block, type='blueBackground'}

Please do not summarise these articles.  Synthesize.  Use the lecture just below to help
```

  * [Lecture on one way to write a synthesis paper--This should pop-up a new tab/window but you'll have to log in to canvas because that is how the videos are stored.](https://northseattle.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=44737fc2-c8cb-4286-9dcf-ac4b011de256){target='_blank'}


2. Put your writing into the 'one doc to rule them all'.  Give that page a new heading, a title. Highlight that title and go to the 'insert' menu item and insert "bookmark".  You should see a little blue ribbon and a "link" that you can copy and paste into slack...

3. Share your work on slack by linking to it in the slack channel #[week-2](https://spr23generalpsych.slack.com/archives/C050WQ8NV7Z){target='_blank'}.

4. Read and comment upon some of your classmates submissions.  In google docs, you can highlight any part of their page and then create a comment by right clicking or using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + alt + m"

5. Please fill out this [Importance of Sexuality Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpnmmTRSjBNa50tTLHsUX3venfF8aTe85CCXVha6cFeO_Sew/viewform?usp=sf_link){target='_blank'}.  It is anonymous. I do not collect information that can be personally tied to you. If you are logged into your google account, google will show you your email address and say that you can use your account to 'store' your work so that you can come back to it. But that's google and not the survey.  I don't track your email.

* It's not required, but it's helpful for my classes because it is useful to see how surveys are supposed to work. 

## Conversation Questions

These are questions that I'd like to discuss in class/zoom sessions.  I think that if you've done the reading/watching of videos, you may have the ability to contribute to the conversation.

A) What is the confirmation bias?
B) What is a workflow?
C) What value is there in synthesizing information?




# Week 3  April 17 {#Week3}

## It's a pretty dense unit.

## Do, Watch, and Read the following

A. Make a note of how much you think you understand about biological influences of psychology. For example, you might simply "I understand 20% of biological influences on our lives". If you aren't sure what this means, post a question to the #muddy-point-board in slack.  For what it's worth a lot of students mistakenly interpret this question as "how much does biology cause our behavior". That's not what I'm asking.  I'm asking to assess how much you think you understand about biology causing behavior.  

B. Pick a behavior--a feeling, an action, a thought, but try to keep it simple (In fact thoughts may be too hard) and write a few sentences that explains how biologically it happens. **Do this before watching/reading below**

C. [Layers of Psychological explanation--10 min](http://faculty.seattlecolleges.edu/faculty/brian.holt/vids/Fall2019General/The_systems.mp4){target='_blank'}

D. [Biopsych youtube playlist, 10 videos of various lengths](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswtFvhRvOliHzeDfuBPIdsSf){target='_blank'}


E. Read [Chapter 3 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/3-introduction){target="_blank"}


F. Skim Nancy Chick, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}

G. Skim Alfie Kohn, [The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/){target="_blank"}


## Do the following

1. Reassess your understanding from above A.
2. What would you add to your understanding in B?
3. As chatGpt to what the neuronal threshold is, and then ask it what changing the threshold would do to "selective signal transmission". Ask it questions, challenge it, drill down a bit.   Share your questions and its answers in your google document. Include some of the back and forth.
4. Whether or not the textbook and videos led to any new learning, identify what you would like to know more about.  What is still missing for you?  Put this into your one google doc to rule them all by placing it in a new page
    * On that new page, write a quick title like "psycho-biology I'm interested in"
    * highlight that title, and then go to the "insert" menu and insert "bookmark".  You should see a little blue ribbon
    * if you click on that text, you should see a "link" option. Copy that link and...
5. ...share your ideas from # 3 above to the Channel [#week3](https://spr23generalpsych.slack.com/archives/C0541QYC788){target='_blank'} by pasting that link into Slack.
6. Read some other posts from classmates and comment about some areas of interest.

## In Class/zoom Conversation Questions

These are questions that I'd like to discuss in class/zoom sessions.  I think that if you've done the reading/watching of videos, you may have the ability to contribute to the conversation.

A) How does your brain know the difference between real and imaginary?
B) Where is "information" in the brain?
C) what metaphors are useful to think about how the nervous system works?

# Week 4 April 24 {#Week4}

## Do, Watch, and Read the following

A. Like last week, Pick a behavior--a feeling, an action, a thought, but try to keep it simple (thoughts may work here) and write a few sentences into your google doc that explains how the environment causes the behavior. Make sure it's different from week 3.

Said another way, explain what is happening in the environment to elicit the behavior.  For clarification, you could say last week the biology is **how** a behavior works while this week you are explaining **when** it works. **Do this before watching/reading below**

>    As an example, consider driving a car down a street and you hit the brakes.  The behavior is the stepping on the brake.  What environmental stimulus 'caused' the stepping on the brake?

B. Read/skim [Chapter 6 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/6-introduction){target="_blank"}

C. [Learning theories youtube playlist, videos 1: 2 (this reads as 1 through 2)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsCPfmo03BZBkLURdfDubMX){target='_blank'}

D. [Video on the law of effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fanm--WyQJo){target='_blank'}

E. [Remaining Learning theories youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsCPfmo03BZBkLURdfDubMX){target='_blank'}

F. @Naik_2001 

  * Link to their article [Behaviorism as a theory of personality](http://personalityresearch.org/papers/naik.html){target='_blank'}


## Do some stuff:

1. Reassess your understanding from above, week 4, part A. Can you see what has changed in your understanding?  Can you jot down some ideas that shows this new learning?  Maybe some vocabulary?  Maybe some vocab that is still confusing.
2. Is your chosen behavior better explained by classical conditioning or operant conditioning?  What key feature led you to this choice?
3. Whether or not the textbook and videos didn't lead to any new learning, identify what you would like to know more about.  What is still missing for you?
4. Choose a new behavior that you want to change its frequency.  Like eating more chocolate.  I mean less.  Less chocolate.  How might you change the **environment** so that you eat ~~more, damn I mean~~ less chocolate?
5. Link your writing for  what you just wrote in #3 and #4 to the Channel [#week-4](https://spr23generalpsych.slack.com/archives/C053EJS671S){target='_blank'}.  Search for it in the Slack Search Bar.
6. Comment and try to engage with a few of your classmates on this assignment.  
    * In particular, try to give feedback--kindly--where you found someone's writing clear or unclear.  
    * Don't simply say this is clear or not. 
    * Share your interpretations of what they wrote. You could say something like "when I read this section, I see a couple of different ways to understand it.  Here is 1, here is another.  Do one of my interpretations line up with your intentions?"


# Week 5 May 1 {#Week5}

<span style="color: violet;">Lots to do this week.  Buckle up. Get moving.</span>

## New layer of explanation: Cognition background

So this week throws us into the deep end of the pool regarding the way that we think about the world.

Probably before human beings have been writing and painting on the inside of caves there has been some quality of activity that we would recognize as “thinking.”

Fast forward to the 60's when computers began to displace workers in the workplace, the concept of 'computer as a machine" crept into the collective conscious of people across the planet and we began to recognize that in some ways humans have a cognitive ability that might be modeled as a computer. 

In other words, during the fifties and sixties, Humanity received a new lexicon for describing things like memory, thinking, and processing information.  You could call it the 'information processing model" of the Brain.

Our contemporary understanding of long-term memory is *because* we first had a computer part called a hard drive. I'm oversimplifying it a bit, but what I want to impress upon you is that a lot of the hypothetical constructs that we use today to describe thinking came about because we invented computers. Yes, we all had some concept of memory before computers.  But computers gave us a new metaphor to operationally define how memory might work.  **Key phrase "operational define"**

Once we had a lexicon about computers we then began to use that lexicon to describe humans. It's not a perfect model, but it's taught us a lot about the limits of our cognitive powers.

## Instructions

To begin, and before you start doing more reading, I want you to first imagine some scenario. Maybe it's simple like watching a bird.  Maybe you can do it write now as you read these instructions.

While you do this, imagine that you are able to witness your thoughts from the point of view of another person, or perhaps a different side of yourself.   

>"so, I can see myself, Brian, sitting at his computer writing these words and I notice that Brian looks up at the window and appreciates the leaves in the sun on the Rhododendron outside this room; it was around then that Brian thought to use 'watching a bird' as a part of the assignment. He also felt a little like he'd rather be out in the sun but a lot of people need him to finish this.  Brian also considered not including that last sentence."

It might be that you are watching your behavior and then noting the pattern of how/where your thoughts come about; it might be an auditory exercise where you're able to listen and hear the words you're saying.  Most of you do this naturally, but some of you might not have a lot of experience in observing your own thoughts.  This is a metacoginitive exercise.

## Do One of the following (Part A)

I am only asking you to think of one of the following. You can write about this material, but you **may want to keep it private**, stored in another document.  Notice that I'm **not** asking you to post your writings about this imagined scenario, described next. 

* Think about why you might not ask somebody out on a date.  A lot of the first thoughts that come to your mind will be relatively broad and vague. A good example of this is going to be a fear of rejection. If you think about this particular example, try to think about a specific person that you do, but do not, want to ask out on a date, and think about the follow-up thoughts that arise when you say "I'm afraid of being rejected”. What comes after "afraid of being rejected?"  Play with answers around  "what if you are rejected?"  **you don't have to put this in your one google doc**

* Or think about somebody you are romantically involved with but are afraid to bring up a topic. I'm not really interested in the topic itself, but what I am interested is to have you write down the obstacles you perceive to be present making this topic difficult, and then to analyze your thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions about those obstacles. **you don't have to put this in your one google doc**

* Or, if you are not involved in a romantic relationship, think about a difficult conversation with an authority figure. Something you would like to tell them,  But won't because of what you perceive to be obstacles to that conversation. **you don't have to put this in your one google doc**

Again, you don't have to do all of these, I am asking you to identify 1 of the above and to think about your thoughts. Specifically, which thoughts arise and then think about the cascading thoughts that follow.  Asking “so what” might be useful.   For example, “I don't want to ask that person out because I'm afraid they will turn me down.”  So what?  Because rejection means….  So what?   do this a few iterations.


## Do the following (Part B)

### Biases

1. Make a guess as to the number of cognitive biases there are. If you don't know what this means, that's okay. Guess anyway.  Write down the guess in your one google document.

2. Go to Wikipedia and look up "list of cognitive biases".  Use the full phrase. Now, right down how many cognitive biases you see on the page (estimates are fine...don't count the actual number!)

3. Pick 3 of your favorite biases from that Wikipedia list and describe them in your own words; include a link to them along with a proper reference.  I don't have a preference for which referencing style. 

## Read the following

A. Read/skim [Chapter 7 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/7-introduction){target="_blank"}

B. Read the following excerpt (just below in blue) from the book The Craft of research @boothCraftResearch2016

C. Read Nancy Chick, again, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}

D. Read Alfie Kohn, again, [The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/){target="_blank"}

```{block,type='blueBackground'}
<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Craft of Research Excerpt</h2>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why write our research up?</h4>

For some of you, the invitation to join into a expert research conversation may still seem easy to decline but if you accept it you'll 

One answer is that we write not just to share our work but to improve it before we do.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Write to remember</h4>

Experienced researchers first write just to remember what they read. A few talented people can hold in mind masses of information, but most of us get lost when we think about what *Smith found in light of Wong's position, and compare both to the odd data in Brunelli, especially as they are supported by Buscovich but what was it that Smith said?* When you don't take notes on what you read, you are likely to forget or, worse misremember it.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Write to understand</h4>

The second reason for writing is to see larger patterns in what you read. When you arrange and rearrange the results of your research in new ways, you discover new implications, connections, and complications. Even if you could hold it all in mind, you would need help to line up arguments that pull in different directions, plot out complicated relationships, sort out disagreements among experts. 

*I want to use these claims from long, but her argument is undercut by Smith's data. When I put them side-by-side, I see that Smith ignores this last part of Wong's argument. aha! If I introduce it with this part from Brunelli, I can focus on one more clearly. *

That's why careful researchers never put off writing until they've gathered all the data they need: they write from the start of their projects to help them assemble their information in new ways. 

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Write to test your thinking</h4>

But even when they agree that writing is an important part of learning thinking and understanding some still wonder why they can't write up their research in their own way, why they have to satisfy demands imposed by a community that they have not joined, or even want to, and conform to conventions they did nothing to create. 

*Why should I adopt language in forms that are not mine? Aren't you just trying to turn me into an academic light yourself? If I write as you expect me to, I risk losing my identity.*

Such concerns are legitimate (most teachers wish students would raise them more often). But it would be a feeble education that did not change you at all, and the deeper your education the more it will change the "you" that you are or want to be.

That's why it is so important to choose carefully what you study and with whom. But it would be a mistake to think that learning to report sound research must threaten your true identity. It will change the way you think, but only by giving you more ways of thinking. You will be different by being freer to choose who you want to be and what you want to do with your life. 

But the most important reason for learning to write in ways readers expect is that when you write for others, **you demand more of yourself and when you write for yourself alone.** By the time you fix your ideas in writing, they are so familiar to you that you need help to see them not for what you want them to be *but for what they really are.* 

You will understand your own work better when you try to anticipate your readers inevitable and critical questions: how have you evaluated your evidence? Why do you think it's relevant? What ideas have you considered but rejected?

## Do the following Part C

1. Without using an anecdote, defend this statement: "Multitasking is a myth". Defend means to use a combination of logic and evidence, so be sure to do a bit of outside reading on the topic. When you do this part of your work, be mindful of the critical thinking standards.  This work should be in your google doc.

2. Link your work to the [#week 5](https://spr23generalpsych.slack.com/archives/C055A2RF38E){target='_blank'} channel

3. Do A [self-reflection Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCKXCNvH-nSdnuCz0OrFUcQPZXVEugR4D5lyBiZzNKYVkANw/viewform){target="_blank"}

    * The text boxes you see in this survey will expand to accommodate what you need to write. In other words, don’t feel like you must only say like 3 words to just fit the box shown.

## Critical Thinking

The closest thing to a rubric we may have in my class is a list of critical thinking attributes. You can find them in the [syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.j2nlxy74qee8){target=”_blank”}. 

Though the critical thinking attributes are found there, I don't spend a lot of time talking about critical thinking attitude, but they would include things like patients, humility, curiosity, etc.  They are just as important but not something I focus on in this class.

### Some Intro videos on Critical thinking

Here is a simple [Introduction to critical thinking, broadly](https://youtu.be/3CkLAMLTkmI){target='_blank'}

It doesn't go into detail about the critical thinking standards found in the syllabus; maybe a video on that will come later.  


## Using the library {#useLibrary} 

The library has set up a simple library guide for our class.  You can find it here: [Abnormal Psychology library guide](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/psych220). I

```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note: Don't pay for articles</span>

One important word of advice is to never pay for a scholarly article. If you go online and use Google, or even Google Scholar to find online sources, you may be directed to the publication that will charge you a large amount of money to access just one article.  So don’t do that.

Generally there are ways to get articles through our library, so don't pay for articles.
```


To get started with our readings, you'll need to use our Library (online, of course) to obtain many of the articles.  

Finding journal articles is a skill that gets better with practice.  This happens to be why Librarians are so helpful.  They've actually been trained so if you can't find an article, it's okay to ask librarians for help.  

In fact, here is how you can [get help from North Seattle's library staff](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/askus). 

### Relationship of an article to its Journal

Using hierarchies helps us organize information. Journal articles, or for that matter the file directories on your computer, work somewhat like an address for a person's home. There are several different parts that give us information to track down and locate whatever it is we're looking for, be it a computer file, or Journal article. Basically, a journal article  has the following components, some of which may be familiar to you :

      Database (of periodicals)
        Periodical (eg., magazine, newspaper, scholarly journal)
         Year (of publication)
           Volume Number
            Volumne Issue number
             Page Number (optional, often unnecessary)
               Article Title
                  Author

So, to find an article, you'll need to know the parts above.  When you are given a list of references, or citations, nearly all of the information needed above is given to  you.  What is not given, or at least is done implicitly with web searches, is access to the top part, the database.  

#### Here is a typical citation:

>Author(s). (year of pub). "Article Title." <span class='underline'>Periodical title</span>. Volume Number (issue number).

The information in a citation isn't presented in the same hierarchy as above, but all of the necessary parts are there.  

Here is an example citation (reference) for something we may read.  Can you identify the periodical?

>Jay Efran, Michael Lukens, Mitchell Greene. 2007. “Defining Psychotherapy: The Last 25 Years Have Taught Us That It’s Neither Art nor Science.” <span class='underline'>Psychotherapy Networker</span> 31 (2). 

Most of the items in the list above are self-explanatory. I want to focus a bit about periodicals.

```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on formatting citations: underlining publication titles</span>

In print, publication titles are *italicized*.  I have a very hard time noticing that subtle font.  

When you submit a written manuscript for printing, publication titles are <span style='text-decoration: underline'>underlined</span> because traditionally manuscripts were typed with typewriters, and to be able to type italicized words required an entire additional alphabet represented in the hammers.  So, underlining was how you could emphasize a word, and the printer--a physical person--could notice the author's formatting intent and correctly publish the final product in italics. 

It's a bit different now with our computers, obviously.  Still, I have a hard time seeing italicized words and will occasionally use underline. 

So, sometimes I'll underline pub titles, sometimes I'll italicize. I have no rule on this.  I am chaos manifested.  Beware. 
```

#### Periodicals

These are just the names of the major publication. _The New York Times_, is colloquially known as a newspaper but technically it is a periodical. <span class='underline'>The Journal of Abnormal Psychology</span> is also a periodical. 

When we search for articles, we have to first know which journal, or periodical, owns that article.  So it is a little counter intuitive but once we have identified an article we would like to read, we have to first find out whether or not our College has access to that periodical.  

To do that, we have to use our colleges periodical locator.

### Finding a journal using Periodical locator

#### Periodical locator {#PeriodicalLocator} 

Notice the first link within [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles).  It should say "Periodical Locator"

There are many databases, inside of these databases are pages of journals, and inside those journals are articles. 

**We need to use the periodical locator to determine which database houses which periodical.  With that, we can then open up that periodical and get the article**


```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on 'free' articles and tuition/fees</span>

Part of the fees that you pay as a student are used to pay subscriptions for these periodical databases. We have a small, but pretty good selection. Major universities have much larger collections due to their size and tuition/fee structure.

So in a way, you are **not** actually getting this for free because you are paying for library access. That's the benefit of taking classes from a college. If you were not an active student, you would not be able to see many of these articles.

So, download them all!
```

##### Here's the main point:  

I've given you a list of Articles to read. To read them, you must first find them; some will be out in the internet, some will be in our schools' databases. So, use the information I've given you to find out which location (database, Wikipedia, google, google scholar) you'll need to search to obtain the full article. You will start by using the periodicals locator tool.

Let's use that @efran_defining_2007 article.  

1. Go to  [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles) and click on the periodical locator.  

2. Type in the periodical for Efran's piece. 

You will see a link with the periodical's name.  Go ahead and click on this but beware of the next instruction:

3. Once you have clicked on that link you may want to start searching within that publication. But do not do that. Instead, notice a little bit further down the search box you should see something that says "View online" and beneath that you should see something that says "proquest research library".   It’s this piece we need.

That Proquest research library is the database that you've all paid fees to access. So you need to remember that database name.

4. While remembering that database name, you need to go back to  [North's Article page](https://libguides.northseattle.edu/welcome/articles).

5. Notice what is presented here. You can see Periodical locator, but notice "A to Z" list of databases.  (You might also notice just below two links; one to academic search and the other to Proquest).

![North's Find Periodicals](../images/NorthLibrarySearch.png)

6. Click on "A to Z"

7. You might notice that there are 67 databases that North Seattle has premium access to. In our case we're going to be looking for the proquest direct database. And we can either click on the letter "P" or we can just type in proquest direct.


```{block, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='sidenote'>Note on Popular sources</span>

You may also notice the little tag "popular" next to proquest link.  That's an indicator that the articles are not peer reviewed and so aren't exactly cutting edge science. Even though this particular journal we are looking for, _Psychotherapy Networker_, is flagged as a popular type, it is a place for therapists to share their thoughts on the profession so there is a lot of value in it.

For help in distinguishing the different types of sources, the library has some guides:

* [Scholar vs popular](http://libguides.northseattle.edu/c.php?g=97441&p=630690)

* [Find Scholarly Journals](http://libguides.northseattle.edu/c.php?g=97441&p=630669)

```

8. Opening Proquest from your home, or remotely, you will need to validate your credentials. In other words, you need to prove that your are in fact students of North Seattle before you can continue, which is why you've been prompted to give your last name and student ID number. Once you do that you'll then be able to see inside of the proquest database. Then you can now search for the article.


    - 8a. If you don't know your @ seattlecolleges.edu email, or email password, you can go to this location [https://tools.seattlecolleges.edu/Initialize/resetmypassword](https://tools.seattlecolleges.edu/Initialize/resetmypassword){target='_blank'} to update it, reset/change the password. If you still can't get access, let me know.

9. You should see you simple search box, where you can enter in important bits of information. I often start with the author's last name, in this case, Efran,and then some unique identifying feature of the article. A few key words of the article title, or perhaps the full article title will be useful.

But notice that next to the text boxes there are drop down menus. You need to use those, otherwise the search engine will just search for your terms anywhere in the document and will provide too many 'hits'. Instead, you should indicate ‘Efran’ as author, and "defining" in the document title. (of course, you could search any way you like).

When you search for those two terms in their respective fields, you will get two hits and one of them is the article we need. You should notice that it is a full text, not all databases provide full text documents. But in this case it's a full text. You can either print it or read it online.

Yay.  Now you can find the other articles.
