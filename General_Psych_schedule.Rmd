# Background before we begin

  A. First of all, welcome. My intention is to keep instructions brief and simple. 

  B. You are always welcome to ask for clarification. It is helpful to your instructor if you try to ask the class first because often the class can be helpful. So, please first ask a question in slack. If it's personal, please use my email account brian.holt@seattlecolleges.edu

  C. It is absolutely crucial that students, teachers, all of us, respect that everybody comes to this class with different experiences, abilities, and intentions..

  D. It can be embarrassing to ask for help. Please try to ask anyway.

  E. My intention as the instructor is to teach you ways to evaluate quality knowledge and to practice quality thinking and quality writing. The context of this endeavor is going to be in psychology.

  F. Computer requirements: 

   1. You must have access to a real computer for writing. If you cannot afford a laptop or do not have a laptop or computer please contact me because we actually have free rentals for students. 

   2. A tablet or smartphone will be insufficient. It's fine to do some communication (texting etc) using those tools, but for real writing you're going to need a real computer or a laptop. 
  
  3. You'll need to have quality access to the internet.  IF you don't have consistent access to the internet from home, we have loaner hotspots that you can borrow for free.  They should give you internet at home.
  
G. Software (apps)

  1. A web browser, like firefox, chrome. 

  2. A free Google doc account. If you have Gmail you already have a Google account for documents and spreadsheets. **This is a requirement; no other word processing software will be allowed.** I have reasons and we can talk about them but unless it is related to a disability accommodation you must be using Google docs.

 
H. Here is the pattern of the course: 

  1. Each week you will be given a list of things to read and it's list of things to do. 
  2. Most of what you'll do is some type of writing assignment in google docs. I will give you instructions and support for how to do this. 
  3. When you have finished the weeks assignment, you will post a link to your work in slack.
  4. Assignments should be submitted in a timely fashion. Friday is the standing due date, with reasonable flexibility. 



# Week 1 Jan 1 {#Week1} 

## What do you want to focus on
Think about what you want to learn:

Some topics in the past that I have taught include the following and you may find them useful starting points to think about your own process for this quarter.

1. Critical thinking
2. Technical writing new paragraph finding published research
3. Evaluating the quality of published articles, for example contrasting popular sources from academic or scholarly.
4. General introduction to the content of psychology
5. Theories within psychology
6. Criticisms of psychology
7. Limits of psychology
8. Philosophy of science
9. Working within groups
10. Psychology as it relates to other disciplines
11. Power structures
12. How to have inclusive group meetings
    * what are good ground rules for meetings

Any and all of these above could qualify.
The goal here is for us to individually and collectively think of about what you'd like to learn in our time together.

This list is not exhaustive. There's some things that you may want to focus on or add. Perhaps this might include cognitive dissonance about being a white person and being told that you've got white privilege. What are some ways one can think about opening up to that feedback?

Although I have some expert content knowledge in psychology, I don't know everything. I have my own biases. But I might be someone who can help guide you.

I'm sure there may be things you'd like to learn about and practice and I would be open to hearing those about things, maybe find ways to incorporate them into the overall class. 

## Read Some stuff

1. [The syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/){target=”_blank”}

2. [Miller's law of communication (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.exo9wouxy9qk){target=”_blank”}

3. [George Orwell, Politics and the English Language, 1946 (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.f3hxyeh73uh7){target=”_blank”}

4. [The 9 standards of Critical thinking (in the syllabus)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jwo68U8f3gWTWgu_EuTNyGQD2KQeQROsqP_BauADs1g/edit#heading=h.j2nlxy74qee8){target=”_blank”}

5. [Textbook, chapter 1: What is Psychology?](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/1-introduction){target=”_blank”}

6. Dictionary/Wikipedia definitions on: 

      *Anthropomorphize
 
      *Ethnocentrism

```{block,type='blueBackground'}

Okay, the following items ( 7 & 8) deserve a little bit of explanation on my side, and patience on yours.  You may be a very practical sort of person who very much does not like philosophy.  Still, without it, we would not have science. It's True!  Do you know what  Ph.D stands for?  Check it out.

Anyway.  While watching these videos, and reading the sources, just down some notes, including reactions, emotions and thoughts, try to track where your mind wanders (if it wanders), also notice when you get distracted, for example, what part of the reading or video were you just watching?  And don't be afraid to keep asking the question 'so what?' about any and all content. 

That's the kind of question you can put in your one-document-to-rule, or even ask questions on the [muddy point Forum](https://24generalnorthseattle.slack.com/archives/C06C26V4NKE){target="_blank"}


Also, I hope to make these videos a lot better in terms of production.  I think I made them at the beginning of the pandemic and well, bleh.
```
7. Watch intro lecture on epistemology

[![Epistemology 8min](../images/Epistemology_better.png){width="40%"}](https://youtu.be/RHBljDEU5GE "Epistemology"){target='_blank'}

8. Read about "stereotype threat".  Not stereotypes.  There is a difference.  You'll need to find a source or two on your own and be sure to keep track of your sources; include them in your writing as necessary.  


## Do the following

1. Introduce yourself in  [#introductions](https://24generalnorthseattle.slack.com/archives/C06BS0WMB1U){target=”_blank”} 

2. Take a look at the [Getting_started](https://rpubs.com/briholt/Getting_started/){target=”_blank”}, in particular the menu item [__Using Google Docs__](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/711457_14b5e3e44b37451cab75199c01ffc96c.html#oneToRule){target=”_blank”}.

3. Frequently asked questions 

4. Write something about what interests you about psychology in your one google doc..remember, have one document. Be sure to give it a title.  Write about things that interest you and ponder whether psychology is related.  **Don't write a book report**.  Be honest, here. I'm not interested in what you **think** you should be interested.  So if you aren't interested in psych, that's okay!.  Some people take this course because it's a prereq for other courses.  That's okay!

5. On the same google document, make a new page, title it, and write some thoughts down to the following prompts.  

    a) What is your process for thinking clearly?

    b) How do you know something is true?
    

6. [Red scare assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17cknH7NPIA6h9AZXirtSAxFGTvNC_pwYYJhEdcTE3J8/edit){target=”_blank”} 

   *  Do this one without over thinking it.  
   *  add this to your google doc.  You can add it as a new page.

7. When you are done, post to the [#week-1](https://24generalnorthseattle.slack.com/archives/C06C2NGT9K4){target="_blank"} channel  by including a link to your document from step 2 above. 
   
8. Read some of your classmates' posts and comment on some.  



# Week 2 Jan 8  {#Week2}


## Orienting comment

If you're relatively new to taking college classes, you might find it disconcerting that we don't simply have you remember a list of vocabulary words. Sometimes memorization is good. In psychology, as an example, the term "negative reinforcement" is often confused with a form of punishment.  It's not.  Can't be. Punishment is not reinforcement. But that's a digression.

Memory is a relatively shallow level of knowledge. Check out this simple hierarchy pertaining to thinking: [Bloom's taxonomy ](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/blooms-taxonomy-learning-activities-and-assessments){target="_blank"} [-@centreforteachingexcellenceBloomTaxonomyLearning2019].  If you expand the "cognitive domain" you'll see that remembering and understanding are pretty low on this scale.  There are other scales out there, but Bloom is well known.

You might also notice that summary is much lower than synthesis, which is way over under "create".

Back to my point, vocabulary is a very low level type of knowledge. It's not without importance. The more you immerse yourself into a discipline, you'll need to know the vocab for efficient/accurate information.  But that will come while you are in your groove.

And, so, the reasons that human beings create schools and classes, such as ours, is to learn things in a deeper way.

You may be interested to know in Psychology, what causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. You might wonder what causes bipolar disorder or why is it that you enjoy one type of activity but somebody else does not. Or perhaps how it is that certain romantic partners get along while others do not. These are all interesting questions and curiosities.

The moment you start getting into those questions, it would be nice if there were short answers but those short answers are usually simplistic and shallow.

So we have to practice, and it is a practice--you don't just get an education and stop learning--you have to keep practicing what you know and how you know it. And it turns out that 'how you know something' is a philosophical question.

So, week 2 is going to be a lot to do with philosophy. It overlaps a little bit with the materials you watched during week one. But the idea is that you're going to have to reflect a little bit about this epistemological question: how do you know what you know?

```{block, Dangers of URLs, type='blueBackground'}
<span class='underline'>Note on References and only using URLs</span>

Your instructor will frequently remind you to not rely on URLs when referencing. If the URL is available, you should include it in the reference, but whenever you are supporting a claim with a reference you should fill out the full reference, including the author, the year it was published, its title, and the publisher. The reason is that URLs will change from time to time as this happened to your instructor with the bloom taxonomy link.
```


## Read Some stuff

1. Re-read the critical thinking items in the syllabus
    * Write them in your one document to rule them all and give a one-sentence description of each **using your own words.**

2. Read/skim [Chapter 2 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/2-introduction){target="_blank"}.  This means you should read the first page and the summary page of the chapter, and then skim the chapter for things relevant to your work or interests.  Take notes on what you find. You can put them into the google doc if you want.

3. Read @Schwartz1771, [The importance of stupidity in scientific research
](https://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771){target='_blank'}

4. Read [Red scare evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g6-uJELM5zgb-yTRCQ8Ah76P9FccFZ_V2GK6YwP3iw/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}


## Do the following
0. reminder to write down descriptions of the critical thinking standards in your own words.
1. write a synthesis of the 4 sources above (critical thinking, stupidity in science, red scare evaluation, chapter 2).  You may want to consider a comment about whether you think knowledge is static.

```{block, type='blueBackground'}

Please do not summarise these articles.  Synthesize.  Use the lecture just below to help
```

  * [Lecture on one way to write a synthesis paper--This should pop-up a new tab/window but you'll have to log in to canvas because that is how the videos are stored.](https://northseattle.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=44737fc2-c8cb-4286-9dcf-ac4b011de256){target='_blank'}


2. Put your writing into the 'one doc to rule them all'.  Give that page a new heading, a title. Highlight that title and go to the 'insert' menu item and insert "bookmark".  You should see a little blue ribbon and a "link" that you can copy and paste.

3. Share your work by linking to your document in the Discussion #[week-2 completed work](https://24generalnorthseattle.slack.com/archives/C06CQ3T1D43){target='_blank'}.

4. Read and comment upon some of your classmates submissions.  In google docs, you can highlight any part of their page and then create a comment by right clicking or using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + alt + m"

5. Please fill out this [Importance of Sexuality Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpnmmTRSjBNa50tTLHsUX3venfF8aTe85CCXVha6cFeO_Sew/viewform?usp=sf_link){target='_blank'}.  It is anonymous. I do not collect information that can be personally tied to you. If you are logged into your google account, google will show you your email address and say that you can use your account to 'store' your work so that you can come back to it. But that's google and not the survey.  I don't track your email.

* It's not required, but it's helpful for my classes because it is useful to see how surveys are supposed to work.

## Conversation Questions

These are questions that I'd like to discuss in class/zoom sessions.  I think that if you've done the reading/watching of videos, you may have the ability to contribute to the conversation.

A) What is the confirmation bias?
B) What is a workflow?
C) What value is there in synthesizing information?

# Week 3  Jan 15 {#Week3}

## It's a pretty dense unit.

## Do, Watch, and Read the following

A. Make a note of how much you think you understand about biological influences of psychology. For example, you might simply "I understand 20% of biological influences on our lives". If you aren't sure what this means, post a question to the [#muddy-point-board](https://24generalnorthseattle.slack.com/archives/C06C26V4NKE){target="_blank"}. For what it's worth a lot of students mistakenly interpret this question as "how much does biology cause our behavior". That's not what I'm asking.  I'm asking to assess how much you think you understand about biology causing behavior. And don't over think it.  You are just estimating some amount of confidence in your understanding.

B. Pick a behavior; it could be a feeling, an action, a thought, but try to keep it simple (thoughts may actually be too hard) and write a few sentences that explains how biologically it happens. **Do this before watching/reading below**

C. [Layers of Psychological explanation--10 min](https://youtu.be/q_kqltsG9Xs){target='_blank'}

D. [Biopsych youtube playlist, 10 videos of various lengths](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswtFvhRvOliHzeDfuBPIdsSf){target='_blank'}


E. Read [Chapter 3 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/3-introduction){target="_blank"}


F. Skim Nancy Chick, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}

G. Skim Alfie Kohn, [The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/){target="_blank"}


## Do the following

1. Reassess your understanding from above A.
2. What would you add to your understanding in B?
3. Ask chatGpt to what the neuronal threshold is, and then ask it what changing the threshold would do to "selective signal transmission". Ask it questions, challenge it, drill down a bit.   Share both your questions and its answers in your google document. Include some of the back and forth between you and GPT.
4. Whether or not the textbook and videos led to any new learning, identify what you would like to know more about in biological psychology.  What is still missing for you?  Put this into your one google doc to rule them all by placing it in a new page
    * On that new page, write a quick title like "psycho-biology I'm interested in"
    * highlight that title, and then go to the "insert" menu and insert "bookmark".  You should see a little blue ribbon
    * if you click on that text, you should see a "link" option. Copy that link and...
5. ...share your ideas from # 3 above to the the [#week 3 channel](https://24generalnorthseattle.slack.com/archives/C06CHHPT5V4){target="_blank"}
6. Read some other posts from classmates and comment about some areas of interest.

## In Class/zoom Conversation Questions

These are questions that I'd like to discuss in class/zoom sessions.  I think that if you've done the reading/watching of videos, you may have the ability to contribute to the conversation.

A) How does your brain know the difference between real and imaginary?
B) Where is "information" in the brain?
C) what metaphors are useful to think about how the nervous system works?
