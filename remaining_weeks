Read how to evaluate red scare

## Orienting comment

If you're relatively new to taking college classes, you might find it disconcerting that we don't simply have you remember a list of vocabulary words. Sometimes that's appropriate. In psychology, as an example coming the term "negative reinforcement" is often confused with a form of punishment.

But this is relatively a shallow level of knowledge. Check out this simple hierarchy pertaining to thinking: [Bloom's taxonomy ](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/planning-courses-and-assignments/course-design/blooms-taxonomy)

Vocabulary is a very low level type oejof knowledge. And so what are the reasons that human beings create schools and classes such as this is to understand things in a deeper way or in a more complicated Way.

So you may be interested to know in Psychology, what causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. You might wonder what causes bipolar disorder or why is it that you  enjoy one type of activity but somebody else does not. Or perhaps how it is that certain romantic partners get along while others do not. These are all interesting questions and Curiosities.

The moment you start getting into those questions, it would be nice if there were short answers but those short answers are usually simplistic and shallow.

So we have to practice, and it is a practice – you don't just get an education and stop learning--you have to keep practicing what you know and how you know it.  And it turns out that is a philosophical question.

So, week 2 is going to be a lot to do with philosophy. It overlaps a little bit with the materials you watched during week one. But the idea is that you're going to have to reflect a little bit about this epistemological question: how do you know what you know


## Read Some stuff

# Week 3   {#Week3}

## It's a pretty dense unit.

## Do, Watch, and Read the following

A. Make a note of how much you think you understand about biological influences of psychology. For example, you might simply "I understand 20% of biological influences on our lives".

B. Pick a behavior--a feeling, an action, a thought, but try to keep it simple (In fact thoughts may be too hard) and write a few sentences that explains how biologically it happens. **Do this before watching/reading below**

C. [Layers of Psychological explanation--10 min](http://faculty.seattlecolleges.edu/faculty/brian.holt/vids/Fall2019General/The_systems.mp4){target='_blank'}

D. [Biopsych youtube playlist, 10 videos of various lengths](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswtFvhRvOliHzeDfuBPIdsSf){target='_blank'}


E. Read [Chapter 3 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/3-introduction){target="_blank"}

## Do the following

1. Reassess your understanding from above A.
2. What would you add to your understand in B.
3. Whether or not the textbook and videos didn't lead to any new learning, identify what you would like to know more about.  What is still missing for you?
4. Link your writing for #3 to the Channel #More_Biopsych
5. Read some other posts from classmates and find some areas of interest and then list some new sources of information.


# Week 4  Oct 19 {#Week4}

## Do, Watch, and Read the following

A. Like last week, Pick a behavior--a feeling, an action, a thought, but try to keep it simple (thoughts may work here) and write a few sentences that explains how the environment causes the behavior. Said another way, explain what is happening in the environment to elicit the behavior.  For clarification, you could say last week the biology is **how** the behavior works while this week you are explaining **when** it works. **Do this before watching/reading below**

    As an example, consider driving a car down a street and you hit the brakes.  The behavior is the stepping on the brake.  What environmental stimulus 'caused' the stepping on the brake

B. Read [Chapter 6 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/6-introduction){target="_blank"}

## Do the following

1. Reassess your understanding from above A.
2. Is your chosen behavior better explained by classical conditioning or operant conditioning?  What key feature led you to this choice?
3. Whether or not the textbook and videos didn't lead to any new learning, identify what you would like to know more about.  What is still missing for you?
4. Choose a new behavior that you want to change its frequency.  Like eating more chocolate.  I mean less.  Less chocolate.  How might you change the **environment** so that you eat ~~more, damn~~ I mean less chocolate?
5. Link your writing for #3 and #4 to the Channel #Learning-theory
6. Comment and try to engage with a few of your classmates on this assignment.

# Week 5 Oct 26  {#Week5}

## New layer of explanation: Cognition background

So this week throws us into the deep end of the pool regarding the way that we think about the world.

Ever since human beings have been writing and probably painting on the inside of caves there has been some quality of activity that we would recognize as “thinking.”

In the 60s when computers began to displace workers in the workplace, collectively across the planet people began to recognize that in some ways human beings have a cognitive ability that might be modeled as a computer. In other words, during the fifties and sixties, Humanity received a new lexicon for describing things like memory, thinking, processing information.

Our contemporary understanding of long-term memory is *because* we first had a computer part called a hard drive. I'm oversimplifying it a bit, but what I want to impress upon you is that a lot of the concepts that we use to describe thinking came about because we invented computers. Once we had a lexicon about computers we began to use that lexicon to describe humans. It's not a perfect model, but it's taught us a lot about the limits of our cognitive powers.

## Instructions

To begin, and before you start doing more reading, I want you to First Imagine some scenario. I am only asking you think of 1.
While you do this imagine that you are able to witness your thoughts from the point of view of  another person, or perhaps a different side of yourself. It might be that you are watching your behavior and the pattern of how your thoughts come about, it might be an auditory exercise where you're able to listen to the words you're saying.  Most of you do this naturally, but some of you might not have a lot of experience in observing your own thoughts.

## Do the following (Part A)

* Think about why you might not ask somebody out on a date?  A lot of the first thoughts that come to your mind will be relatively broad and vague. A good example of this is going to be a fear of rejection. If you think about this particular example, try to think about a specific person that you do not want to ask out on a date, and think about the follow-up thoughts that arise when you say "I'm afraid of being rejected”.

* Or think about somebody you are romantically involved with but are afraid to bring up a topic. I'm not really interested in the topic itself, but what I am interested is to have you write down the obstacles you perceive to be present making this topic difficult.

* Or, if you are not involved in a romantic relationship, think about a difficult conversation with an authority figure. Something you would like to tell them,  But won't because of what you perceive to be obstacles to that conversation.

Again, you don't have to do all of these, I am asking you to identify 1 of the above and to think about your thoughts. Specifically which thoughts arise and then think about the cascading thoughts that follow.  Asking “so what” might be useful.   For example, “I don't want to ask that person out because I'm afraid they will turn me down.”  So what?  Because rejection means….  So what?   do this a few iterations.


## Do the following (Part B)

### Biases

1. Make a guess as to the number of cognitive biases there are. If you don't know what this means, that's okay. Guess anyway.

2. Go to Wikipedia and look up "list of cognitive biases"

3. Pick 3 of your favorites and describe them in your own words; include a link to them along with a proper reference.  I don't have a preference for which referencing style.  Post your work to the #Biases channel

## Read the following

Read [Chapter 7 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/7-introduction){target="_blank"}

## Do the following Part C

1. Without using an anecdote, defend this statement: Multitasking is a myth.  When you do this, be mindful of the critical thinking standards.

2. Link your work to the #multitasking channel

# Week 6 Nov 2 {#Week6}

## Read the following

A. Read/skim [Primer for Behaviorism and Semantic networks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MMziOQh7NjWRnrzCZDT99ArOu8Nv6CzQfTEfbSCzjYA/){target="_blank"}. This will be a review, basically.

* skim this but pay closer attention the semantic sections with the schematics for cars
* Think of a subject.  Maybe it's something academic like math, biology.  Maybe it's about sports, or in particular a single sport, like (the only one that matters) basketball.
   * in what specific ways would the semantic network be different between a novice and expert?  I don't expect you to know technical terms here (like nodes, edges) but I want you to have an appreciation for how people may differ in terms of their networks

B. Read [Chapter 8 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/8-introduction){target="_blank"}

C. Read [How to Study, By Brian Holt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9LFqr5DQnj_0HU7lQrTdmo9kG2otEITHXUrGzYQdvg/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

## Do the following

1. Identify the metaphorical dragons that interfere with your learning. Maybe one of them is anxiety about performing well. And this dragon makes it difficult to focus and to filter out extraneous distractions. Or maybe another dragon is the lure of interesting things in your social network making your phone buzzed with texts or other activity.  Maybe it’s a dragon of inertia, making it hard to start new things.  There are many dragons.

2. After you’ve listed a few (at least 2) of these dragons, what can you do to either slay these dragons or to help them help you learn new material?  If you aren’t sure where to begin, you might consider your textbooks ( 7 and 8) and to read that material again as if you’ve been given a secret scroll...a treasure map that helps you.  Obviously the textbook is not going to give you a simple formula like if you have this problem X then do this  solution y. If you take this adventure, keep notes as you re-read the chapters.  Ask the chapters questions...even if the chapter can't answer it.

Write down your solutions and post them, or at least the ones you feel comfortable sharing in the Dragon channel.

# Week 7  Nov 9 {#Week7}

## Read the following:

A. Nancy Chick, [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/){target="_blank"}

B. Alfie Kohn, [The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/){target="_blank"}

## Do some work:

A. [Do the self-reflection quiz](https://forms.gle/fTvysGbvga1tLZzN9){target="_blank"}

B. Post a re-write of one [or two] of your past written assignments.  Please choose assignments from work completed; if you didn't get to do the synthesis paper, for example, don't use it here.

 * post re-writes to channel:  #re-writes-for-reflection

 * You may want to use the critical thinking standards as a lens on your past work.  For instance, are there places you could be more deep in terms of complexity?  What research could inform how you think about your work from the textbook?  This is just a suggestion.

# Week 9 Personality Nov 23  {#Week9}

## Be sure to check out [Week 11 on social psychology](#Week11)

As an assignment it may be taxing so you'll want to plan out your next few weeks

## Personality
This week is an introduction to personality.

You will want to read the textbook and to keep some ideas in mind.

The first is that there's basically four major theories of personality but that there tends to be sub theories within them.

The four major that I think of include psychoanalysis (with several sub-types often associated with particular people), Humanism (with existentialism as a sub-type), Cognitive-behavioral, and finally Trait approaches (the Big-5 being the most researched).

The second thing to be aware of is that there are several persistent and possibly impossible problems to solve in studying personality. The classic example: "is a behavior the consequent of a person's personality, or internal trait system, or is that behavior a result of environmental influence?"

```{block,type='blueBackground'}
Edit 11/25
Another way to think about this assignment:   If students take an intro to psych class, should they not be able to reasonably answer the question "what is identity?"  Not exhaustively answer it, not write a master's thesis, but to be able to point to the complexity of the problem while still committing to some conclusion.

```

# Week 10 Abnormal Nov 30 {#Week10}

## Be sure to check out [Week 11 on social psychology](#Week11)

As an assignment it may be taxing so you'll want to plan out your next few weeks

## Abnormal Psych

Abnormal psychology has a lot of hidden dangers.Which means I feel responsibility to call out a couple of things in a way that's different than past weeks.

First thing is to Beware of the medical student syndrome. This is the tendency for medical students to self-diagnose when exposed to new and exotic illnesses. The same thing happens in Abnormal psychology. The profession tries to make diagnosis clear to those who actually make diagnosis. But that means that non-experts will overestimate their own ability to accurately diagnose self and others.

So please don't. Don't diagnose yourself and don't diagnose others.  If you think that you or someone you know struggling with a mental disorder don't try to diagnose them or even offer advice. Instead ask them what they need, and listen.

## Read/Watch

* [Abnormal Psych Chapter Textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/15-introduction){target='_blank'}

* @efran_defining_2007  You'll need to look this up using the Library's database.  The specific database is called Pro-quest.  [This schedule has instructions for doing this](#PeriodicalLocator).

* [Lecture on Diathesis Stress Model](https://youtu.be/1MaaORgCHvc){target='_blank'}   15 minutes

* [Lecture on how anxiety is about survival](https://youtu.be/bVdEGLSmXlk){target='_blank'}   7 minutes

* [Optional Lectures on depression](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsr6gT7c0HT9rbpW5X-lstj){target='_blank'}  50 minutes'ish

* [Optional case study interview of a person suffering from Schizophrenia](http://faculty.seattlecolleges.edu/faculty/brian.holt/vids/AbnormVids/Schizophrenia_type_1_7min.mp4){target='_blank'} 7 min

* Questions to constantly ask about disorders
Questions to ask yourself when thinking about abnormal psychology

  * What is normal versus abnormal?  What does the textbook say?

  * What dominates your thinking about human motivation? Is there a particular psychological theory that you tend to gravitate to? For instance, are all things biological? Cognitive? Do you feel a need to simplify?

  * Remember earlier in the quarter when I had you watch the systems within psychology video. This video was a brief introduction to the fact that human motivation is layered. Certainly there are biological reasons for why we do what we do, but there's also learning histories, cognitive processes, personality variables, but also social influences. All of these things are happening all of the time. So somebody says that they're depressed, do you have a tendency to say oh there's something biological wrong? Socially wrong?

  * Keep in mind how do we measure abnormal behavior.
  * Who has the power to say one thing is normal versus another? Does that power come from cultural norms?

  * When a diagnostician gives a diagnosis, who do they serve?

## Do some stuff

* Respond to anything above.  Write maybe 2 or 3 paragraphs.

* Share your writing with the slack Channel #abnormal

* Comment on 2 or 3 of your classmates work.
