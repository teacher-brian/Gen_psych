# Week 4 Oct 16 {#Week4}

## Do, Watch, and Read the following

A. Like last week, Pick a behavior--a feeling, an action, a thought, but try to keep it simple (thoughts may work here) and write a few sentences into your google doc that explains how the environment causes the behavior. Make sure it's different from week 3.

Said another way, explain what is happening in the environment to elicit the behavior.  For clarification, you could say last week the biology is **how** a behavior works while this week you are explaining **when** it works. **Do this before watching/reading below**

>    As an example, consider driving a car down a street and you hit the brakes.  The behavior is the stepping on the brake.  What environmental stimulus 'caused' the stepping on the brake?

B. Read/skim [Chapter 6 of your textbook](https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/6-introduction){target="_blank"}

C. [Learning theories youtube playlist, videos 1: 2 (this reads as 1 through 2)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsCPfmo03BZBkLURdfDubMX){target='_blank'}

D. [Video on the law of effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fanm--WyQJo){target='_blank'}

E. [Remaining Learning theories youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEwZwMNQswsCPfmo03BZBkLURdfDubMX){target='_blank'}

F. @Naik_2001 

  * Link to their article [Behaviorism as a theory of personality](http://personalityresearch.org/papers/naik.html){target='_blank'}


## Do some stuff:

1. Reassess your understanding from above, week 4, part A. Can you see what has changed in your understanding?  Can you jot down some ideas that shows this new learning?  Maybe some vocabulary?  Maybe some vocab that is still confusing.
2. Is your chosen behavior better explained by classical conditioning or operant conditioning?  What key feature led you to this choice?
3. Whether or not the textbook and videos didn't lead to any new learning, identify what you would like to know more about.  What is still missing for you?
4. Choose a new behavior that you want to change its frequency.  Like eating more chocolate.  I mean less.  Less chocolate.  How might you change the **environment** so that you eat ~~more, damn I mean~~ less chocolate?
5. Link your writing for  what you just wrote in #3 and #4 to the canvas discussion room for  [#week-4](https://canvas.seattlecolleges.edu/courses/16702/discussion_topics/160525?module_item_id=752178){target='_blank'}.
6. Comment and try to engage with a few of your classmates on this assignment.  
    * In particular, try to give feedback--kindly--where you found someone's writing clear or unclear.  
    * Don't simply say this is clear or not. 
    * Share your interpretations of what they wrote. You could say something like "when I read this section, I see a couple of different ways to understand it.  Here is 1, here is another.  Do one of my interpretations line up with your intentions?"
